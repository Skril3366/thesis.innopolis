The NFT Lazy Mining process on the Rarible Marketplace can be said to be inefficient because the process still has to be done one by one. Not to mention other problems that arise such as wrong numbering and typing errors or typos. This resulted in the Lazy Minting NFT process on the Rarible Marketplace becoming less effective. This problem will make it difficult for NFT creators if they have a large number of digital works. Therefore, this research aims to build an automated NFT Lazy minting system on the Rarible Marketplace on the Ethereum Blockchain using AutoIt, so that the NFT Lazy minting process on the Rarible Marketplace becomes more effective and efficient. The method used in the development of the Lazy Minting NFT automation system in the Rarible Marketplace is Agile Development. This research resulted in a Lazy minting NFT automation system on the Rarible Marketplace on the Ethereum Blockchain. The conclusion of this study is that the application of this system is able to make the NFT Lazy mining process on the Rarible Marketplace more effective and efficient. This can make it easier for NFT creators in their NFT sales process.},

The game was first launched on mobile devices, chromebook, and tablets in June 2022. Players would be able to enjoy the game on a variety of platforms. This study employs content analysis to explore game mechanics and in-game elements, specifically focusing on how they affect the players' construction of their characters' gender. The analysis is limited to chapters featuring dressing-up and destiny event stages, where clothing choices are central to gameplay. Judith Butler's theory of performativity is a framework to examine whether the game reinforces traditional gender norms or encourages players to subvert them. The findings reveal that, despite the game's emphasis on player choices, the mechanics, especially those related to clothing and its associated features, still largely adhere to conventional gender expectations. The main character (player) is constructed to be female by repeatedly donning feminine clothes in mostly bright colors and elaborate accessories. All categories of clothing (type, color, and accessories) in the game have a particular bias towards traditional feminine elements. Therefore, during dress-up stages, players have limited choices in gender expression besides the feminine style dictated by the mechanics. However, the in-game actions, part of destiny events, show a contrasting experience. These events give players choices that impact the story without imposing specific gendered behaviors. This complexity indicates that limitations and opportunities to challenge gender norms exist in Empress's Choice through its game mechanics.},

NFTs can be traded for digital assets (images, music, videos, virtual creations) where ownership is recorded in a smart contract on the blockchain. One of the difficulties faced is that it takes a very long time for NFT creators to create a large number of works of art in a short time. To make it easier for creators to create NFT images, Daniel Eugene Botha, or better known as Hashlips, created a Hashlips Art Engine algorithm that can be used to create many different NFT images based on the layers provided using the canvas API and node.js. The hashlips algorithm also generates metadata as an important role in the mechanism for searching and exchanging NFT data and measuring the percentage of rarity in the resulting image. In addition, this study also shows the time required to create NFT images.},

Hundreds of complaints have been filed in which the buyer or seller claimed to be defense personnel and displayed fake ID proofs to gain trust. Because Traditional Marketplace currently lacks a feature for reviewing sellers, users who want to buy products have little doubt about whether the seller can be trusted with the items they sell. Users can use it to determine whether a seller is reliable or not. Also, as a reference for purchasing items from the seller using NFT tokens. The Web3 is advancing more quickly in our society. Hopefully, it will have the widest possible audience for its reliable exchange, ownership transparency, and certified products. An NFT marketplace is a gateway to trade digital assets.The latest web assets, from simple artwork to expensive asset exchange, are available for purchase and sale on the NFT marketplace. Non-fungible tokens' ownership verification capabilities are their main advantage. Given that they are on a blockchain network, NFTs can help to link ownership to a single account. Since the blockchain can permanently store information about the product, checking for rarity and authenticity will soon be a thing on physical products too. In the rapidly evolving landscape of online marketplaces, the emergence of NFT (Non-Fungible Token) technology has ushered in a new era for both the sale of new and used products. This abstract delves into the dynamics of an NFT marketplace that caters to a diverse range of commodities, offering a seamless platform for buyers and sellers alike. This innovative marketplace leverages blockchain technology to tokenize both new and used products, providing each item with a unique digital identity that is securely stored on the blockchain. The use of NFTs ensures authenticity and provenance, instilling trust among users and mitigating the risk of counterfeit goods. The platform employs smart contracts to automate transactions, streamlining the buying and selling process while reducing the need for intermediaries.},

This study investigates the evolving trends in the NFT landscape and the complexities of regulatory frameworks in two major economies: China and the USA. Both nations exhibit contrasting regulatory approaches, impacting the strategic development and adoption of NFTs and digital assets. In China, stringent governmental controls over blockchain technology, coupled with a cautious stance toward cryptocurrency trading, have led to a regulated yet growing market for NFTs, focusing more on state-approved platforms and innovation within restricted parameters. Conversely, the USA's approach, though varied across federal and state levels, reflects a more open yet fragmented regulatory environment, enabling a more diverse fintech ecosystem that fosters creativity and competition. The comparative analysis highlights how regulatory climates shape investment strategies, with China prioritizing compliance with state policies and fostering blockchain-driven cultural and creative sectors, while US-based fintech companies leverage a more flexible regulatory landscape to innovate and diversify their NFT offerings. These differing strategies affect how fintech firms operate, allocate resources, and engage with emerging technologies. Moreover, the study explores investment trends, noting the rise of venture capital funding and strategic partnerships tailored to each country's unique regulatory outlook. The insights provided emphasize the importance for investors and fintech enterprises to develop adaptive strategies that account for regulatory nuances, technological advancements, and market preferences.},

However, this adoption has been accompanied by a surge in cryptocurrency fraud, causing significant losses to financial organizations and individuals. One way to mitigate these losses is to use Federated Learning (FL) techniques to detect fraudulent cryptocurrency transactions. This paper provides an overview of secure, privacy-preserving, and scalable Blockchain-based Federated Learning (BCFL) as a promising solution for slowing the exponential growth of cryptocurrency fraud. BCFL enables multiple entities to collaboratively train machine learning models for detecting fraudulent cryptocurrency transactions without sharing their private data, thus preserving privacy. However, Integrating differential privacy and Secure Multi-party computation (SMPC) models in BCFL presents an additional scalability challenge. This study provides an overview of BCFL, evaluating existing research on its security, privacy, and scalability challenges in detecting cryptocurrency fraud. The review explores existing research and various methodologies, highlighting advancements and challenges in creating effective, privacy-conscious fraud detection solutions for cryptocurrency transactions. We first discuss the current state of BCFL in fraud detection, along with its potential advantages and limitations, and then discuss the existing research gaps. In particular, this paper examines various BCFL frameworks, consensus algorithms, and block architectures, emphasizing their strengths and limitations in the context of cryptocurrency fraud detection to develop scalable and privacy-preserving solutions. We compare various solutions that address scalability and privacy challenges in BCFL, including adopting a geographically distributed cloud computing model that utilizes SMPC and lightweight consensus algorithms and protocols to manage computational overheads.},

Some individuals may use a cutting-edge technology called Blockchain (BC) to digitally transfer assets such as currency, paperwork, and real estate (RE). Each transaction, monetary exchange, and shared information facilitated by a Peer-to-peer network (P2P) can be carried out through a designated node. Methods: this paper proposes a method for secure transfer of land ownership using BC Technology without the involvement of intermediaries. Buyers and sellers are entering into a land ownership agreement via the Ethereum network. The decentralised systems has been to enhance their reliability. Currently, there is a growing development of decentralised solutions based on blockchain technology to tackle the limitations of centralised systems. Results: the application of BC technology gradually mitigates the security concerns of the LR system. Due to the fact that each block is connected to the hash of the preceding one, each hash value will be unique. The SHA algorithm is employed for this purpose. Conclusion: the ownership of the property cannot be transferred to the customer through the application. However, the smart contracts allow for automated updating of records},

NFTs digitally represent any assets that may hold photos, gifs, audio, videos, or any other data-based storable material. These assets may come under a variety of asset groups, including art, in-game goods, and entertainment collecting units. What makes them appealing is their exclusivity, in the sense that each NFT is unique to itself, and ownership is determined by a digital certificate. In the first half of 2021, NFT sales totaled more than a billion. The NFT Software as a service (SAAS) based system is a one-of-a-kind offering and concept for thinking outside the box and presenting intellectuals and creative treasures and exhibiting these objects to ensure the security and integrity of digital assets. The existence of core decentralized networks allows for unrestricted access to this material as well as further analysis. Based on the Web3 Blockchain technology, these assets may be traded and represent next-generation ownership. In this paper, Adaptive Improved Convolutional Neural Networks (AICNN) are used to forecast NFT to provide a SAAS NFT collector. We also introduce Tree-seed Chaotic Atom Search Optimization (TSC-ASO) algorithm to optimize the forecasting process. The proposed method of NFT price forecasting is evaluated and compared with the existing forecasting methods. To produce an accurate report for NFT price forecasting, the proposed method will be effective.},

To reduce storage cost, divide the network into separate segments, and allow nodes to maintain track of a portion of the blockchain's data ledger, it was initially employed in databases. This technology is an excellent choice for enhancing blockchain performance because of its practical requirements and the speed at which blockchain applications are developing. It has garnered a lot of interest. There are a number of unresolved issues regarding the review and analysis of sharding. In this paper, we examine current state-of-the-art sharding schemes by categorizing them according to blockchain type and sharding technique---more specifically, cross-sharding with low communication overhead and systematically and thoroughly analyzing the benefits and drawbacks of each. Sharding lowers communication overhead since the performance of blockchain apps that use it has significantly improved over the method that should be studied for reducing the communication cost of block consensus. We present various open addresses after doing a comprehensive review and analysis of the communication overhead.},

  abstract = {Blockchain technology originated alongside Bitcoin as a novel method of conducting financial transactions. It has garnered significant attention from both industry and academia in recent years, emerging as a prominent area of research. It is a decentralized record-keeping system that holds transactional information. The scale of a blockchain network expands according to the growth in the number of nodes and transactions, resulting in issues related to storage capacity, data processing speed, and time delay. These issues have a direct impact on the scalability of a blockchain network. Currently, scalability is one of the prominent concerns in the field of blockchain technology and an active research area. This study conducts a comprehensive survey of the scalability challenges faced by blockchain technology in several sectors. It also examines potential solutions based on consensus mechanisms, smart contracts and directed acyclic graph (DAG). It is observed that the proposed scalability solutions target enhancing system throughput, reducing costs, and improving blockchain efficiency. Therefore, we examine, compare, and evaluate the literature using these specific criteria. Moreover, a survey of existing blockchain based survey papers is presented. A comparative analysis of these survey papers is presented along with their recency score, which is determined by the number of recent publications reviewed in a survey paper. By "recent," we mean the current year (or the publication year of a survey paper) and the three years prior to it.

This has been accomplished by following a comprehensive hybrid literature review. Our study has identified 23 blockchain networks that consume significantly less power and release fewer carbon dioxide emissions compared to the Bitcoin network. Some of these environmentally friendly networks include Algorand, Fantom, MobileCoin, and Electroneum. Additionally, we have found various projects and organizations that support greener blockchain initiatives, such as the Renewable Energy Certificate Mechanism, Green Digital Finance Alliance, GreenTrust, and the Energy Web Foundation. While several projects in this area have been recognized and examined, comprehensive research and analysis are still needed to provide empirical evidence regarding the power consumption and carbon dioxide emissions of these claimed environmentally friendly blockchains. This is due to the relatively early stage of development in this field.},

We contribute a verified boardroom voting smart contract featuring maximum voter privacy such that each vote is kept private except under collusion of all other parties.  We also integrate property-based testing into ConCert using QuickChick and our development is the first to support testing properties of interacting smart contracts. We test several complex contracts such as a DAO-like contract, an escrow contract, an implementation of a Decentralized Finance (DeFi) contract which includes a custom token standard (Tezos FA2), and more.  In total, this gives us a way to write dependent programs in Coq, test them semi-automatically, verify, and then extract to functional smart contract languages, while retaining a small trusted computing base of only MetaCoq and the pretty-printers into these languages.},

  abstract = {The application of game-based learning adds play into educational and instructional contexts. Even though there is a lack of standard methodologies or formulaic frameworks to better inform game-based intervention development, there exist scientific and empirical studies that can serve as benchmarks for establishing scientific validity in terms of the efficacy of using games to achieve serious outcomes. The development of these games does not normally follow a specific set of guidelines, which limits replication. There is a need to reflect on such a multidisciplinary process and infuse knowledge from relevant disciplines towards developing a unity of considerations and approaches beyond the disciplinary perspectives. An infused and trans-disciplinary methodological framework could serve as a guideline to inform the development process of a game-based approach. With these perspectives, this paper aims to provide an example of how relevant theories and frameworks can be adopted collectively in order to inform a development process. Based on a digital game intervention aiming to support the delivery of Relationships and Sex Education (RSE) in the UK, this paper reflects on trans-disciplinary considerations, informed by frameworks such as the Four-Dimensional Framework (4DF), the Intervention Mapping (IM) approach, Mechanics Dynamics Aesthetics model (MDA) and Learning Mechanics-Game Mechanics (LM-GM) mapping. IM, when infused with the game design considerations of 4DF, provides a more procedural perspective to game-based intervention development, collectively reflecting a participatory development approach. This subsequently provides the basis upon which other theoretical and methodological frameworks such as the MDA and the LM-GM models can be embedded in order to marry the pedagogical aspects with the entertainment attributes of gameplay. These components, when integrated, may formulate a trans-disciplinary model that can be adopted and adapted by other researchers, designers and developers.},

On the other hand, game development is still a risky and costly endeavor, and researches on reducing its risks and costs continue to be important. Procedural content generation or PCG is the state-of-the-art method to speed up and automate the production of various game contents, therefore reducing the said costs and risks. However, how to integrate the method into the lengthy process of game development is still not well understood. In this paper we present a preliminary study on the integration. For the development process, we combine MDA or Mechanics-Dynamics-Aesthetics framework with SCRUM-based Agile methodology. The PCG method for our study is for generating levels of platformer games. We study how the PCG method would be developed in pre-production and production phases with the help of two common development tools, Game Design Document (GDD) and user stories. We discuss our findings and possible directions of future researches.},

Against this background, the purposeful and verifiable tracing of emissions in the energy system is a crucial key element for promoting the deep decarbonization towards a net zero emission economy with a market-based approach. Such an effective tracing system requires end-to-end information flows that link carbon sources and sinks while keeping end consumers' and businesses' sensitive data confidential. In this paper, we illustrate how non-fungible tokens with fractional ownership can help to enable such a system, and how zero-knowledge proofs can address the related privacy issues associated with the fine-granular recording of stakeholders' emission data. Thus, we contribute to designing a carbon emission tracing system that satisfies verifiability, distinguishability, fractional ownership, and privacy requirements. We implement a proof-of-concept for our approach and discuss its advantages compared to alternative centralized or decentralized architectures that have been proposed in the past. Based on a technical, data privacy, and economic analysis, we conclude that our approach is a more suitable technical backbone for end-to-end digital carbon emission tracing than previously suggested solutions.},

The article presents the performative discourse of blockchain advocates as well as the counterarguments presented by journalist, players, and developers, in order to demonstrate that arguments against cryptogaming are not anticapitalist and politicized, but mostly based on common sense. Then, the article investigates game studies concepts for their capacity to further explicate cryptogames, and finds that neither gamification nor playbor are completely fitting. Instead, the article turns to the game research fundamentals of Huizinga and Caillois to cast blockchain gaming in a new light. From this perspective, games like CryptoKitties and Axie Infinity emerge as nested activities that can be approached as play of financial speculation, with the latter approach being significantly privileged in existing games.},

The concept of tokenising the uniqueness of digital elements has emerged thanks to the Ethereum blockchain token standard. This type of token is associated with digital properties in the context of the value of properties as unique identifiers. This feature has expanded the penetration of NFTs in most industries. Despite this, the NFT ecosystem is still at an early stage of development, while the technologies on which NFTs are based are entering a mature stage of development.

  abstract = {Non-fungible tokens (NFT) represent one of the most important technologies in the space of Web3. Thanks to NFTs, digital or physical assets can be tokenised to represent their ownership through the usage of smart contracts and blockchains. The first generation of this technology, called NFT 1.0, considers static tokens described by a set of metadata that cannot be changed after token creation. The static nature prevents their wide spread as they do not support any meaningful user interaction. For this reason, its evolution, called NFT 2.0, has been proposed to make tokens interactive and dynamic and enhance user experience, opening the possibility to use NFTs in more ways and scenarios. The purpose of this article is to review the transition from NFT 1.0 to NFT 2.0, focusing on the newly introduced properties and features and the rising challenges. In particular, we discuss the technical aspects of blockchain technology and its impact on NFTs. We provide a detailed description of NFT properties and standards on various blockchains and discuss the support of the most important blockchains for NFTs. Then, we discuss the properties and features introduced by NFT 2.0 and detail the technical challenges related to metadata and dynamism. Lastly, we conclude by highlighting the new application scenarios opened by NFT 2.0. This review paper serves as a solid base for future research on the topic as it highlights the current technological challenges that must be addressed to help a wide adoption of NFTs 2.0.},

  abstract = {This article examines the discourses surrounding non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in gaming and identifies companies involved in NFTs in the Quebec gaming scene. NFTs boomed in the gaming industry in 2021 and continued to grow in 2022, even as the value of gaming coins plummeted. If successful, some believe they could bring new opportunities to the gaming landscape. We conducted an online ethnography in early 2022 through an innovative web-scanning approach and curation process powered by a professional market intelligence platform. Data was collected from various sources and analyzed via statistical analysis software to understand the discourses of companies, gamers, researchers, and insiders. Findings show that the technical and economic discourse is at least ambivalent if not negative, while the gamer discourse is mostly negative. The burgeoning Quebec scene is currently very limited and divided into two groups: large gaming companies and startups. Despite the crypto-enthusiast craze, our analysis shows that early projects were often criticized by traditional gamers and that professionals in the sector remain skeptical.},

  abstract = {The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has significantly advanced healthcare, but it has also brought about critical security challenges. Traditional security solutions struggle to keep pace with the dynamic and interconnected nature of IoMT systems. Machine learning (ML)-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have been increasingly adopted to counter cyberattacks, but centralized ML approaches pose privacy risks due to the single points of failure (SPoFs). Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a promising solution, enabling model updates directly on end devices without sharing private data with a central server. This study introduces the BFLIDS, a Blockchain-empowered Federated Learning-based IDS designed to enhance security and intrusion detection in IoMT networks. Our approach leverages blockchain to secure transaction records, FL to maintain data privacy by training models locally, IPFS for decentralized storage, and MongoDB for efficient data management. Ethereum smart contracts (SCs) oversee and secure all interactions and transactions within the system. We modified the FedAvg algorithm with the Kullback--Leibler divergence estimation and adaptive weight calculation to boost model accuracy and robustness against adversarial attacks. For classification, we implemented an Adaptive Max Pooling-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a modified Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) with attention and residual connections on Edge-IIoTSet and TON-IoT datasets. We achieved accuracies of 97.43\% (for CNNs and Edge-IIoTSet), 96.02\% (for BiLSTM and Edge-IIoTSet), 98.21\% (for CNNs and TON-IoT), and 97.42\% (for BiLSTM and TON-IoT) in FL scenarios, which are competitive with centralized methods. The proposed BFLIDS effectively detects intrusions, enhancing the security and privacy of IoMT networks.},

  abstract = {Given that the interconnections of NFT and DeFi digital assets with other stablecoins still not sufficiently studied, this paper is two-fold. We first examine the dynamic conditional correlation between gold-backed cryptocurrencies and NFTs and DeFi assets during the period 02/11/2021-05/01/2023. We thereafter assess the diversification potential of gold-backed cryptocurrencies against NFTand DeFi. To this end, we use the time-varying Student's copula to investigate the cross-markets linkages among different assets in dynamic fashion. We afterwards compute the optimal hedging ratios and effectiveness index to better explore the effectiveness of portfolio risk management. Our findings clearly show that the degree of dependence between gold-backed cryptocurrencies and NFT and DeFi tokens tends to vary over time. Our results also display that gold-backed cryptocurrencies act as suitable hedging (or diversifying) assets during normal times. Nevertheless, such assets can be considered as robust safe havens during the 2022 bear market for the most of NFT and DeFi assets. More specifically, PAXG and PMGT are found to be the best safe haven instruments for both NFT and DeFi tokens. DGX also serves as safe-haven assets for some NFT and DeFi assets, but with a lower risk-mitigation capacity compared to PAXG and PMGT. In most cases, DGX tends to act as a strong diversifier. Its hedging feature is only recorded for the NFT Protocol (xNFT) and the DeFi token Chainlink (LINK). Our results are of particular interest to investors and portfolio managers who search for safe havens to mitigate the risk of their NFT and DeFi portfolios.},

Observing difficulties to establish such correspondences in the scientific literature, we proposed to move away from ``classification by genre'' or any other type of taxonomy that deviates from the framework of the ``Rules/Formal schemas'' and the ``set of rules'' component of the gameplay. Thus, we proposed the Gameplay Bricks model as a theoretical framework for Video Game (VG) and Serious Games (SG). We jointly relied on a framework on fractionated executive functions, memory, and attention. The Gameplay Bricks model currently identifies 14 major Metabricks (game mechanics) through seven Metabricks of obligations and seven of prohibitions. We have proposed first correspondences accompanied by examples from the VG-SGs. The limits and perspectives of these first matches were then discussed.},

However, designing and implementing a smart contract is not trivial since upon deployment on a blockchain, it is no longer possible to modify it (neither for improving nor for bug fixing). It is only possible by deploying a new version of the smart contract which is costly (deployment cost for the new contract and destruction cost for the old contract). To this end, there are many solutions for testing the smart contracts before their deployment. Since realizing bug-free smart contracts increase the reliability, as well as reduce the cost, testing is an essential activity. In this paper, we group the existing solutions that attempt to tackle smart contract testing into following categories: public test networks, security analysis tools, blockchain emulators and blockchain simulators. Then, we analyze these solutions, categorize them and show what their pros and cons are.},

While there are many intangible elements that inform game development processes, this review specifically covers the more immediate practical challenges. The review covers a total of 48 papers published between 2006 and 2016, which were all subjected to thematic analysis by three reviewers. The results of the review show that an almost universal characteristic of game development is that it is almost impossible to accurately plan a development project in detail, largely due to the soft requirements inherent in game production which emerge mid-process during development projects, during when testing is coupled with continuous ideation and refinement. Practicing game developers have created their own frameworks that accommodate for this lack of planning. They include flat hierarchies, democratic decision-making, creative autonomy, and informal communication, which are designed to create an environment that maintains creativity and openness to product changes long into the production process. These frameworks vary significantly between studios and often between individual projects. This review also shows that the term `Agile', while often used by both researchers and developers to characterize the process of game development, is not an apt descriptor of how game developers actually work. Agile is used as shorthand for unstructured and flexible development, rather than serving as a descriptor of a definable or unified work method. Finally, as companies develop more complicated hierarchies of stakeholders and staff, the desired flexibility and autonomy of game development becomes increasingly complicated to maintain, and often necessitates more formalized management processes and company structures. In these cases, inherent tensions of game development become more pronounced, and continuous creativity is hard to maintain due to a growing need to formalize processes.},

Consequently, blockchains and existing technologies do not integrate well in a unified framework. This integration is necessary to work around some of the blockchains constraints, such as scalability of transactions and ergonomics. Indeed, blockchains are not suitable for huge data storage, but there are distributed data storage solutions that can be used in a decentralized blockchain application. Regarding ergonomics, the use of blockchain technology should be in the background and transparent for users that may not know how to set up and secure a blockchain-based application.We propose an architecture aiming to easily link existing decentralized technologies and blockchains. We then discuss the impact of this architecture for the video game industry.

It is no longer possible to modify any stored information on a Blockchain, which makes this technology a legitimate disruptor for sectors such as payments, cybersecurity and healthcare. Considering the increasing implementation of blockchain technology in various fields, this paper aims at focusing its application as a basic gaming experience to newbies, who wish to step into the world of blockchain gaming. Firstly, this paper presents the conceptual design and implementation of blockchain gaming in the framework of a 2D game hosted. This game highlights the incorporation of Fungible and Non-fungible tokens (NFT), which represent the rewards collected by the player. The collected reward bonus in the form of NFT is published on the player's OpenSea account, connected to MetaMask. The Game flow includes the development of a user-friendly, theme-based interface supported by Solidity as a technological support for building smart contracts using ERC20 and ERC1155 token standards. IPFS (Inter planetary-file system) is used for decentralized storage of metadata and token images, and Hardhat and Alchemy for deployment and overall execution. This game demonstrates a basic implementation of blockchain in gaming and unveils its broader scope through its incorporation in even simple children's games. This game carries pedagogical significance which can be utilized by the professors to demonstrate the practical usage of fundamental elements of blockchain to the students.},

In many ways, an NFT is like a conventional proof-of-purchase document, such as a paper invoice or an electronic receipt. NFTs are attractive among other things because of verifiability; each sale is recorded as a blockchain transaction, allowing ownership to be tracked. Also, NFTs can be used to transfer digital assets between two mutually distrusting parties, since both the crypto payment and the asset transfer take place in one transaction. With NFTs, all marketplaces can freely trade with the help of decentralized applications (DApps). It is currently estimated that there are over 245 NFT marketplaces (NFTM) listed with over 1000 blockchains as of August 2022 with 68 million blockchain wallet users. With the expansion of markets, they must face challenges and issues. The objective of this review is to study the market dynamics of NFT ecosystems. It also focuses on technical components that enable NFTs and their marketplace. The review provides a deeper understanding of its components, how they are related, and why they are important.

The general purpose of this study is to identify the customers' inclination to perform game modding as a manner of value co-creation which benefits both companies and other game users. The current knowledge regarding the factors determining this behaviour is, relatively speaking, weak. The authors conducted qualitative research in the forms of in-depth interviews and focus groups with Polish game players (including mod users and mod creators). This study provides evidence for the peculiar motives of the customers performing different levels of engagement: mod users are driven by game enjoyment, focusing on the motives and social affiliation of multiplayer groups, while mod creators are mainly motivated by the enjoyment of creation, pride, creativity, and epistemic curiosity; engagement and social affiliation are received by mod creators with unique talents. The paper provides tentative evidence for specific customers' motivations to co-create, which benefits both companies (game developers) and other game users. The players are perceived as an inseparable part of the gaming industry, who deliver extra value to the market through game modding activities. The paper provides useful, executable guidance on how to encourage and support players to engage in value co-creation in virtual words. The study may enrich our understanding of customers' inclinations on both theoretical and empirical levels, showing some of the motivations both to use and create mods. In comparison to previous research, mod creators and mod users were researched separately in this study, and thus a distinction of their different sets of motives was enabled. Both practitioners and researchers may find what is uncovered in the paper engrossing.},

The growing dependence on these advanced, connected environments has led to several operational challenges related to privacy, security, and scalability due to their distributed architectures and the complex interplay among numerous IoT systems. Recently, Blockchain Technology has emerged as a critical solution for addressing privacy and security challenges in intelligent buildings. However, the IoT devices within Intelligent Building spaces (IBDs) are resource-constrained and face notable challenges in performance and scalability. This indicates a need for a more scalable, energy-efficient blockchain solution without compromising security or privacy. To overcome these challenges within IBDs, we propose a novel approach using the Direct Acyclic Graph Blockchain of Things (DBoT), which utilizes IOTA Tangle Blockchains. We develop a lightweight bundle message model that enhances scalability with an advanced algorithm for energy-efficient proof-of-work computation across network nodes. The DBoT architecture significantly boosts scalability and performance in IBD IoT nodes, simultaneously improving user privacy and access control with varied granularity. Our findings show that the Blockchain-based DBoT method effectively ensures secure connectivity and information flow with growing IoT systems without sacrificing performance.},

  abstract = {The time and money spent on video games are rapidly increasing, as the annual U.S game industry consumer spending has reached 23.5 billion dollars. The cost of producing video game content has grown in accordance with the consumer demand. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been suggested as a way to scale production costs with the demand. In addition to lowering content production costs, AI enables the creation of new forms of gameplay that are not possible with the current toolbox of the industry. The utilization of AI in game design is currently difficult, as it requires both theoretical knowledge and practical expertise. This thesis improved game designer workflow in PCG-based game design by explicating the necessary theoretical frameworks and practical steps needed to adopt AI-based practices in game design.    Game designer workflow in PCG-based game design was improved by utilizing the design science research method (DSR). The constructed artefact was determined to be a method in accordance with the DSR knowledge contribution framework, and it was evaluated by using the Quick \& Simple strategy from the FEDS framework. The risks related to artefact construction were assessed in accordance with the RMF4DSR framework. The metrics used to measure the performance of the artefact were determined by employing the GQM framework. Finally, the proposed method was evaluated by following it in constructing a simple PCG-based game with an accompanying AI system. The evaluation was performed by utilizing the FEDS framework in an artificial setting. After gathering and analysing the data from the artefact construction and evaluation, the method was modified to address its shortcomings.    The produced design method is the main contribution of this thesis. The proposed method lowers the threshold for adopting PCG-based game design practices, and it helps designers, developers, and researchers by creating concrete and actionable steps to follow. The necessary theoretical frameworks and decision points are presented in a single method that demystifies the process of designing PCG-based games. Additional theoretical knowledge has been contributed by studying the topic from a practical perspective and extracting requirements from an actual design process. The method can be used as a practical cookbook for PCG-based projects and as a theoretical base for further studies on PCG-based game design.    Future research tasks include evaluating the proposed method in an organizational context with real users. An organizational context also warrants means to managing risks in PCG-based game design projects. Finally, generator evaluation and explicit guidance on generator control are important future research topics.},

  abstract = {Wash trading is considered a highly inopportune and illegal behavior in regulated markets. Instead, it is practiced in unregulated markets, such as cryptocurrency or NFT (Non-Fungible Tokens) markets. Regarding the latter, in the past many researchers have been interested in this phenomenon from an ``ex-ante'' perspective, aiming to identify and classify wash trading activities before or at the exact time they happen. In this paper, we want to investigate the phenomenon of wash trading in the NFT market from a completely different perspective, namely ``ex-post''. Our ultimate goal is to analyze wash trading activities in the past to understand whether the game is worth the candle, i.e., whether these illicit activities actually lead to a significant profit for their perpetrators. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper in the literature that attempts to answer this question in a ``structured'' way. The efforts to answer this question have enabled us to make some additional contributions to the literature in this research area. They are: (i) a framework to support future ``ex-post'' analyses of the NFT wash trading phenomenon; (ii) a new dataset on wash trading transactions involving NFTs that can support further future investigations of this phenomenon; (iii) a set of insights of the NFT wash trading phenomenon extracted at the end of an experimental campaign.},

This study started with an extensive literature review on software reuse and product modularity followed by an exploratory study through several interviews with game and software developers. The results of the literature review and exploratory study was then used to formulate a research model, hypothesis and survey questionnaire. A random sample of 124 games were targeted for this study that were published during the period 2009-2014 on pc and consoles. The period of study is between February 2014 and June 2015.},

Manual auditing, although comprehensive, is time-consuming and heavily reliant on the auditor's expertise. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is growing interest in leveraging them to assist auditors in the auditing process (co-auditing). However, the effectiveness of LLMs in smart contract co-auditing is contingent upon the design of the input prompts, especially in terms of context description and code length. This paper introduces a novel context-driven prompting technique for smart contract co-auditing. Our approach employs three techniques for context scoping and augmentation, encompassing code scoping to chunk long code into self-contained code segments based on code inter-dependencies, assessment scoping to enhance context description based on the target assessment goal, thereby limiting the search space, and reporting scoping to force a specific format for the generated response. Through empirical evaluations on publicly available vulnerable contracts, our method demonstrated a detection rate of 96{\textbackslash}\% for vulnerable functions, outperforming the native prompting approach, which detected only 53{\textbackslash}\%. To assess the reliability of our prompting approach, manual analysis of the results was conducted by expert auditors from our partner, Quantstamp, a world-leading smart contract auditing company. The experts' analysis indicates that, in unlabeled datasets, our proposed approach enhances the proficiency of the GPT-4 code interpreter in detecting vulnerabilities.},

However, the effectiveness of LLMs in smart contract co-auditing is contingent upon the design of the input prompts, especially in terms of context description and code length.Objectives:~This paper introduces a novel context-driven prompting technique for smart contract co-auditing. The primary objective is to improve the effectiveness of LLMs in detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts through enhanced prompt design.Methods: Our approach employs three techniques for context scoping and augmentation, namely: Code Scoping, which involves chunking long code into self-contained code segments based on code interdependencies; Assessment Scoping, which enhances context description based on the target assessment goal to limit the search space; and Reporting Scoping, which forces a specific format for the generated response.Results:~Through empirical evaluations on publicly available vulnerable contracts, our method demonstrated a detection rate of 96{\textbackslash}\% for vulnerable functions, outperforming the native prompting approach, which detected only 53{\textbackslash}\%.

This method not only enhances the detection rate of vulnerabilities but also reduces the dependency on manual auditing, thereby making the auditing process more efficient and reliable.},

  abstract = {We present a novel deep graphical representation that seamlessly merges principles of game theory with laws of statistical mechanics. It performs feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and pattern classification within a single learning framework. Our approach draws an analogy between neurons in a network and players in a game theory model. Furthermore, each neuron viewed as a classical particle (subject to statistical physics' laws) is mapped to a set of actions representing specific activation value, and neural network layers are conceptualized as games in a sequential cooperative game theory setting. The feed-forward process in deep learning is interpreted as a sequential game, where each game comprises a set of players. During training, neurons are iteratively evaluated and filtered based on their contributions to a payoff function, which is quantified using the Shapley value driven by an energy function. Each set of neurons that significantly contributes to the payoff function forms a strong coalition. These neurons are the only ones permitted to propagate the information forward to the next layers. We applied this methodology to the task of facial age estimation and gender classification. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms both multi-layer perceptron and convolutional neural network models in terms of efficiency and accuracy.},

  abstract = {The burgeoning field of rooftop solar panel technology has revolutionized electricity markets, empowering consumers and prosumers to exchange localized energy. Blockchain technology, with its inherent ability to facilitate peer-to-peer (P2P) energy transactions, has emerged as a pivotal player in this evolving landscape. However, despite its promise, blockchain technology in this context is still in its nascent stages, grappling with the notorious `trilemma' of scalability, security, and decentralization. This manuscript delves into the complexities of applying blockchain technology to P2P energy trading, with a particular focus on overcoming the scalability limitations. To address this open challenge, we propose a novel blockchain-based solution named `DYNAMO,' a decentralized market clearance system. The efficacy of this approach is validated through empirical modeling, leveraging data from a real-world case study. Our findings demonstrate that DYNAMO significantly surpasses existing base layer models in scalability, while meticulously safeguarding the fundamental principles of security and decentralization. This research represents a crucial leap forward in unlocking the full potential of blockchain technology for facilitating P2P energy trading, paving the way for a more efficient and decentralized energy future.},

  abstract = {Blockchain technology allows players to own in-game assets and to be rewarded with NFTs or tokens for their game achievements, thus can be a game changer for all the gaming industry. One central issue is how to check that conditions for achievements are met (e.g., that the player completed level 10). Current approaches open cheating backdoors (e.g. if the client checks the conditions) or introduce centralization points (if a backend checks the condition). Ideally, we would like to ``run'' games on chain, but so far that has not been possible due to the high computational cost, especially on Ethereum; however, the development of technologies like proofs of computation can solve this problem. Being able to run games on the blockchain, new decentralized rewarding systems can be built to ensure the fair and transparent rewarding of game achievements.},

  abstract = {This article addresses the issues of scalability and security in blockchain networks, with a focus on sharding algorithms and decentralized data storage. Key challenges include the low throughput and high transaction latency in public networks such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Sharding is examined as a method to enhance performance through data distribution, but it raises concerns regarding node management and reliability. Sharding schemes, such as Elastico, OmniLedger, Pyramid, RepChain, and SSchain, are analyzed, each presenting its own advantages and drawbacks. Alternative architectures like Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) demonstrate potential for improved scalability but require further refinement to ensure decentralization and security. Protocols such as Brokerchain, Meepo, AHL, Benzene, and CycLedger offer unique approaches to addressing performance and transaction consistency issues. This article emphasizes the need for a comprehensive approach, including dynamic sharding, multi-level consensus, and inter-shard coordination. Additionally, a conceptual model is proposed that incorporates the sharding of transactions, states, and networks, which enables greater scalability and efficiency.},

  abstract = {Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) make it possible for companies to give consumers a unique piece of digital data that is represented on a blockchain. Where traditionally, an item in a game was just some code that could technically easily be copied, NFTs can make this game item truly unique and scarce. In this research, the impact of NFTs on stakeholders in a gaming ecosystem is explored.    The developments within the gaming sector regarding NFTs are looked at from the perspective of three principles of the stakeholder capitalism theory, which are the principles of cooperation, engagement, and responsibility. The impact of the implementation of NFTs in games on stakeholders is evaluated from the perspective of these three principles to better understand how NFTs impact the different stakeholder groups in a gaming ecosystem.    For this study, information was gathered by means of semi-structured interviews with five respondents. These respondents are all active in the NFT gaming industry, including CEOs of game development companies, researchers, and game designers.    The findings show several themes that currently play in the NFT gaming scene. Gamers can be engaged with NFTs while also investors and smaller game developers may be engaged more effectively. Also, the cooperation between stakeholders may be improved with NFTs. Though, there are concerns regarding the use of NFTs in games with regard to the responsibilities of the different stakeholder groups.    One of the contributions of this study is the identification of the different stakeholder groups that are part of an NFT gaming ecosystem and their relations with each other. Furthermore, several managerial implications are presented for game developers based on the conclusions.    Game developers should take into account the impact NFTs may have on their game design. For example, the fact that NFTs can have a monetary value means that the in-game economics may become more complex. Also, in certain situations, a game may be developed via a Decentralized Autonomous Organisation (DAO), meaning NFT and token holders can vote on development proposals. This may change the role a game developer has compared to traditional game development.    Expanding the knowledge of NFTs in games is necessary as, for some, Play-to-Earn has become a source of income. If this trend continues, the field of NFTs and Play-to-Earn may play an important role in the future economy.},

  abstract = {In the 2020s, it is clear that children now spend most of their days in front of the screen. During screen time, playing games is one of the most important activities of children. However, technology is developing day by day and innovations are quickly becoming a natural part of life. Therefore, children now need to be creative people who produce innovation, rather than just consuming themselves with the digital content offered to them. For this reason, students need to improve their creative thinking skills. Also, they need guidance for producing with technology. Considering this circumstance, this research, which was aimed at 5th and 6th grade school students designed educational games in a blended learning environment, employed a single group pretest posttest experimental design research. At the beginning and end of the research, the creativity level of students was examined by using the Torrance Test of Creativity. The study tries to seek an answer to the following question: ``How does the educational game designing process affect 5th and 6th grade students' creative thinking development?''. As a result, it was determined that there was a statistically significant difference in the creative thinking skill scores of those who designed their own educational game. This result is tangible evidence that the game is not only a drill and practice activity but it also presents a creative thinking environment for students.},

  abstract = {Through 2020 and 2021 there has been an increase in the number of projects using blockchain technology. The high return of investment of many cryptocurrencies have made their popularity surge and with this the number of start-ups. In this environment the author examines and collaborates with a start-up combining blockchain technology with AR to create a platform in which interactions are possible through the metaverse with animal companions. This collaboration will be for the development of the business model. However, questions arise whether the development of such a venture is possible, whether the market is ready for it and what objectives and challenges the start-up might face in the future. For this the author develops a series of investigations ranging from situational, internal and financial analyses, combining numerical and non-numerical data. The results indicate a market where VCs are investing heavily, there is one significant competitor in a similar stage and a potential mature competitor that could enter the market at any minute. The situation of the start-up is positive due to the funding, project development and technological edge. Nevertheless, due to the early stage, lack of revenue might pose a threat in the future. This study successfully documents and evaluates key factors surrounding the start-up.},

Fully immersive Virtual Reality (VR) is increasingly used in an educational context where adoption and practical use is growing, facilitated by more powerful and affordable VR headsets. Teaching the fundamentals of mathematics and its applied use can be challenging. In this paper, we propose the use of SG, VR, and the Learning Mechanics-Game Mechanics (LM-GM) framework for SG game analysis in the design of a game. The goal is to develop mathematical thinking skills and increase student engagement and retention through the use of gamification in the creation of a highly engaging and pedagogically sound immersive learning experience.},

  abstract = {Distributed cryptographic ledgers ---aka blockchains ---should be a functional programmer's dream. Their aim is immutability: once a block has been added to the chain it should not be altered or removed. The seminal blockchain, Bitcoin, uses a graph-based model that is purely functional in nature. But Bitcoin has limited support for smart contracts and distributed applications. The seminal smart-contract platform, Ethereum, uses an imperative and object-oriented model of accounts. Ethereum has been subject to numerous exploits, often linked to its use of shared mutable state by way of its imperative and object-oriented features in a concurrent and distributed system. Coding a distributed application for Ethereum requires two languages: Javascript to run off-chain, which submits transaction written in Solidity to run on-chain. This paper describes Plutus Platform, a functional blockchain smart contract system for coding distributed applications on top of the Cardano blockchain. Most blockchain programming platforms depend on a custom language, such as Ethereum's Solidity, but Plutus is provided as a set of libraries for Haskell. Both off-chain and on-chain code are written in Haskell: off-chain code using the Plutus library, and on-chain code in a subset of Haskell using Template Haskell. On-chain code is compiled to a tiny functional language called Plutus Core, which is System F{$\omega$} with iso-recursive types and suitable primitives. Plutus and Cardano are available open source, and Plutus Playground provides a web-based IDE that enables users to try out the system and to develop simple applications.},

  abstract = {More and more serious games have been developed in recent years for patients with aging, rehabilitation, mental, and other healthcare needs. Often, such healthcare games have different experiments or evaluations associated. Rapid advancements in healthcare games see increased regulatory concerns. Unfortunately, there is no authority like the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in United States for regulatory approvals of healthcare games. Yet, it is not appropriate to use the traditional pharmaceutical FDA approval, which is a tedious and time-consuming process, for healthcare games. We propose a Healthcare Game Blockchain (HGB) to support game developers, healthcare providers, healthcare authorities, and patients. For healthcare game developers, HGB is a common platform to deposit healthcare game prototypes or products. HGB can collect feedback data for analysis similar to drug clinical trials on efficacy and toxicity. Volunteers can be recruited for clinical trials using the healthcare games available on HGB. Once the healthcare games are accepted with a recommended usage, patient gamers can leverage the same HGB platform for treatments following the instructions of healthcare providers. HGB allows healthcare professionals to track the patient responses during their healthcare game medication. Big data analytics can be developed to monitor patient outcomes and healthcare game efficacy. Security and privacy issues are critical in healthcare data handling. HGB has the potential to resolve these limitations and inefficiencies improving data collection, data sharing, and data security by leveraging on the intrinsic properties that blockchain technology provides. This paper explores the possibility of integrating blockchain and healthcare games supporting clinical trials and treatment monitoring.},

This study designs a charity NFT auction platform on the Fisco Bcos blockchain, using multi-signature algorithms to ensure NFT authenticity, ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) signatures for transaction integrity and traceability, NFTs and virtual currencies to reduce costs, and IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for storage. The implemented system achieves 2104 TPS throughput with 492-millisecond latency, increasing transaction processing with low latency. Overall, the platform aims to address charity issues like opaque fund flows, high costs, and fake initiatives through the strategic application of blockchain and NFT functionality.},

  abstract = {In the information age, electronic documents (e-documents) have become a popular alternative to paper documents due to their lower costs, higher dissemination rates, and ease of knowledge sharing. However, digital copyright infringements occur frequently due to the ease of copying, which not only infringes on the rights of creators but also weakens their creative enthusiasm. Therefore, it is crucial to establish an e-document sharing system that enforces copyright protection. However, the existing centralized system has outstanding vulnerabilities, and the plagiarism detection algorithm used cannot fully detect the context, semantics, style, and other factors of the text. Digital watermark technology is only used as a means of infringement tracing. This paper proposes a decentralized framework for e-document sharing based on decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and non-fungible token (NFT) in blockchain. The use of blockchain as a distributed credit base resolves the vulnerabilities inherent in traditional centralized systems. The e-document evaluation and plagiarism detection mechanisms based on the DAO model effectively address challenges in comprehensive text information checks, thereby promoting the enhancement of e-document quality. The mechanism for protecting and circulating e-document copyrights using NFT technology ensures effective safeguarding of users' e-document copyrights and facilitates e-document sharing. Moreover, recognizing the security issues within the DAO governance mechanism, we introduce an innovative optimization solution. Through experimentation, we validate the enhanced security of the optimized governance mechanism, reducing manipulation risks by up to 51\%. Additionally, by utilizing evolutionary game analysis to deduce the equilibrium strategies of the framework, we discovered that adjusting the reward and penalty parameters of the incentive mechanism motivates creators to generate superior quality and unique e-documents, while evaluators are more likely to engage in assessments.},

The artwork generated in the form of NFT has made it an increasingly lucrative market, while there is also a lot of interest in the application of NFT to games, the metaverse and the financial economy. Therefore, this research paper will investigate the market development trend of NFT in the context of metaverse and the future outlook, especially to make a more detailed analysis of several important fields, taking art and branding industry as examples. Based on case studies and data analysis, NFT's high pricing is attributed to a variety of factors, where the company's marketing approach is mostly creative and cross-pollinated to appeal to a wide audience. NFT has the ability to grow in the cultural sector as a whole, but it is challenging to sustain long-term prosperity due to the lack of NFT artworks and the likelihood of excessive speculation. Overall, this paper explores the value and potential of NFT using current research and accurate statistics, particularly in the areas of branding and the arts. These results shed light on guiding further exploration of NFT's market prospect and its own value realization.},

One is refined resilience analysis utilizing game theory to study the consequences of selfish behaviors of users (miners), and the other is the extension from a linear (chain) structure to a non-linear (graphical) structure for performance improvements, such as IOTA and Graphcoin. The first question that comes to people's minds is what improvements that a blockchain system would see by leveraging these new advances. In this paper, we consider three major metrics for a blockchain system: full verification, scalability, and finality-duration. We \{ establish a formal framework and\} prove that no blockchain system can achieve full verification, high scalability, and low finality-duration simultaneously. We observe that classical blockchain systems like Bitcoin achieves full verification and low finality-duration, Harmony and Ethereum 2.0 achieve low finality-duration and high scalability. As a complementary, we design a non-linear blockchain system that achieves full verification and scalability. We also establish, for the first time, the trade-off between scalability and finality-duration.},

  abstract = {The NFT phenomenon has disrupted the traditional notion of digital ownership. As distinct digital assets, NFTs serve as proof of ownership for crypto assets, for example, art, music, trading cards, or in-game items. The NFT market experienced unprecedented growth in 2021, with NFTs solidifying their position as a transformative technology in the digital realm. The market growth peaked during the boom period in January 2022, and has since declined, experiencing a major slump in June 2022. The market is not yet commonplace for everyone. Within the market, the initial sales market is more challenging to enter than the subsequent sales market since the former requires a higher seller entry cost. This paper decouples the initial and subsequent sales markets on the largest NFT market platform, OpenSea, and examines the markets across the two distinct periods in the NFT market history: the boom period of January 2022 and the slump period of June 2022. For the study dataset, sales transaction records are extracted from Opensea. This study discovers many properties which are invariant between the boom and slump: higher pricing in subsequent sales than in initial sales, rapid market movement (more in the initial sales), skewed revenue generation, and statistically strong regressors from Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to distinguish between different resale return types, ranging from \_large loss\_ to \_large profit\_. The finding indicates that the initial and subsequent sales markets are not identical. However, the composition and behaviour of the markets listed prior would be scale-free to the markets' economics stages. When we simulated a resale return with a zero hidden cost, the number of profit returns in resale inflated, suggesting that hidden costs should be surfaced and/or minimised to improve an investor's experience in the subsequent sales market. Our study sheds light on the dynamics of the NFT initial and subsequent sales markets across the boom and slump periods. By evaluating the two market types separately, we contribute to demystifying the subsequent sales market, which can be veiled without the market type distinction due to the initial sales market's over-representation. Ordinary people, who are generally incapable of affording a seller's entry cost in the initial NFT sales market, would notably benefit from this study. Since the study covers the two extreme periods, its finding will provide certainty, even in an atypical period.},

  abstract = {Non-fungible tokens, commonly known as NFTs, have risen to prominence in the recent, rapidly developing digital era, attempting to revolutionise the way that we perceive ownership, authenticity, and value in the online world. At their core, NFTs are unique digital assets verified using blockchain technology, the same decentralised ledger system underpinning cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum for example. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, which are interchangeable or ``fungible'' (that is, where one Bitcoin is always equal to another Bitcoin), NFTs are distinct and non-interchangeable. This non-fungibility means each NFT has a unique value and cannot be replaced on a one-to-one basis with any other token. Instead, they should therefore, be considered rare collectable items in the digital realm, akin to owning a one-of-a-kind artwork, but in a digital format.},

  abstract = {Digitalization triggered a transformation in our society, leveraging recent innovations introduced by digital technologies to empower real systems with advanced capabilities. Blockchain emerged as a disruptive technology to advance trustless scenarios by enforcing data immutability and change traceability. Deployed in the Blockchain, smart contracts support such transformation, enhancing the application logic toward a trust scenario. Bug in the smart contract can lead to irreversible consequences, producing faulty transactions or unexpected behaviors. Furthermore, the immutable nature of the Blockchain restricts the ability to make updates if unforeseen circumstances or necessary modifications arise. For these reasons, smart contracts' continuous inspection and improvement are fundamental to prevent and react to such issues. In this context, Digital Twin is an emerging approach for creating virtual replicas of assets, processes, or systems. By establishing a bi-directional connection, Digital Twin reflects the twinned entity state while simulating its behavior to enable an iterative evolution. In this paper, we propose an approach that exploits Digital Twin capabilities to support dynamic smart contract improvements. By monitoring and analyzing transactions, Digital Twin can suggest possible refinements to the developers by discovering smart contract inconsistencies or deviations from the expected behavior. Those improvements can refer to a change in logic or parameter optimization. These change proposals are then evaluated in the Digital Twin approach, which eventually updates the smart contract on the Blockchain. We assess the feasibility of the proposed approach using a train management application related to the smart transportation domain.},

  abstract = {The field of game design for educational content lacks a focus on methodologies that merge gameplay and learning. Existing methodologies typically fall short in three ways: they neglect the unfolding of gameplay through players' actions over a short period of time as a significant unit of analysis; they lack a common consideration of game and learning mechanics; and they falsely separate the acts of playing and learning. This paper recommends the gameplay loop methodology as a valuable tool for educational game design, as it addresses these major shortcomings. Furthermore, this paper outlines how this methodology can be supported by knowledge from subject-specific didactics, considering both the curriculum and its mediation (contributed by experts from educational practice), as well as by methods of player-centered design in order to ensure the appropriateness of learning objectives and techniques of mediation in the context of a particular field of knowledge, the game's appeal to its target group, and the effectiveness of the learning mechanics. A case study of the design and production phases of Antura and the Letters, a literacy game for Arabic refugee children, illustrates the uses of the gameplay loop methodology situated in the described broader approach to educational game design. Finally, this paper explains the results of an impact study revealing that the approach indeed provides the opportunity to merge playing and learning.},

NFT provides a profitable platform for digital art aiming to monetize their works more effectively and efficiently. However, NFTs are sometimes misused by others to profit from an artist's work without their permission. The purpose of this study is to analyze the regulation of NFTs in Indonesia. This research uses a normative juridical method. The results show that Indonesia does not yet have specific regulations regarding NFTs. However, there are several existing regulations that can serve as a legal framework for the existence of NFTs. As an asset, commercial transaction of NFTs based on APPEBTI Regulation Number 8 of 2021 concerning Guidelines for Organizing Physical Crypto Asset Trading on the Futures Exchange, considering that NFTs are crypto assets stored on Blockchain networks and represent digital works. As intangible movable goods, NFTs based on the Information and Electronic Transactions Law (ITE Law) and Government Regulation Number 80 of 2019 concerning Transactions Through Electronic Systems. As digital art, legal protection can refer to the Copyright Law. Challenges in the implementation of NFT trading include the potential for piracy, where someone's work is turned into an NFT without permission through a process called minting. To address these challenges, specific regulations on NFTs are needed. Another possible solution is the development of policies by NFT marketplaces to prevent further losses by blocking NFTs that are proven to originate from misused works.AbstrakNon-Fungible Token (NFT) ialah simbol di masa yang akan datang terkait pasar yang semakin mengikuti zaman. NFT menyediakan sarana profitable digital art yang bertujuan untuk memonetisasi karya mereka dengan cara yang lebih efektif dan efisien. Namun terkadang NFT digunakan oleh orang lain untuk mendapatkan keuntungan dari sebuah karya seniman tanpa memiliki izin dari seniman itu. Tujuan daripada penelitian ini untuk menganalisis pengaturan NFT di Indonesia. Penelitian ini menggunakan metode yuridis normatif. Hasil dari penelitian ini memperlihatkan bahwa di Indonesia belum terdapat aturan khusus terkait NFT. Akan tetapi terdapat beberapa aturan yang dapat digunakan sebagai payung hukum keberadaan NFT. Sebagai aset, transaksi perdagangan NFT berada dalam payung hukum Peraturan BAPPEBTI Nomor 8 Tahun 2021 tentang Pedoman Penyelenggaraan Perdagangan Pasar Fisik Aset Kripto di Bursa Berjangka, dengan pertimbangan bahwa NFT merupakan aset kripto yang tersimpan di jaringan Blockchain dan karya digital. NFT sebagai Benda bergerak tidak berwujud berada dalam payung hukum UU ITE dan Peraturan Pemerintah Nomor 80 Tahun 2019 tentang Transaksi Melalui Sistem Elektronik. Sebagai karya digital perlindungan hukum dapat merujuk pada UU Hak Cipta. Tantangan dalam pelaksanaan transaksi perdagangan NFT yaitu dimungkinkannya. Tantangan dalam implementasi NFT yaitu terdapat potensi pembajakan terhadap suatu karya seseorang menjadi obyek NFT melalui minting. Untuk mengatasi tantangan tersebut perlu pengaturan yang khusus NFT. Solusi lainnya yang dapat dilakukan misalnya dibuatnya kebijakan dari Pasar NFT untuk mencegah kerugian lebih lanjut dengan memblokir NFT yang terbukti berasal dari karya yang disalahgunakan.},

Our research focuses on the optimization of prompt engineering for enhanced security analysis, and we evaluate the performance and accuracy of LLMs using a benchmark dataset comprising 52 Decentralized Finance (DeFi) smart contracts that have previously been compromised. Our findings reveal that, when applied to vulnerable contracts, both GPT-4 and Claude models correctly identify the vulnerability type in 40\% of the cases. However, these models also demonstrate a high false positive rate, necessitating continued involvement from manual auditors. The LLMs tested outperform a random model by 20\% in terms of F1-score. To ensure the integrity of our study, we conduct mutation testing on five newly developed and ostensibly secure smart contracts, into which we manually insert two and 15 vulnerabilities each. This testing yielded a remarkable best-case 78.7\% true positive rate for the GPT-4-32k model. We tested both, asking the models to perform a binary classification on whether a contract is vulnerable, and a non-binary prompt. We also examined the influence of model temperature variations and context length on the LLM's performance. Despite the potential for many further enhancements, this work lays the groundwork for a more efficient and economical approach to smart contract security audits.},

We examined 66 games ``in the wild'' to develop the AVRGG and used it to identify 5 subgenres of AVR games including David(s) vs. Goliath, Hide and Seek, Perspective Puzzle, Order Simulation, and Lifeline. We describe these genres, which account for nearly half of the 66 games reviewed, in terms of the AVRGG framework that highlights salient asymmetries in the mechanics, dynamics, and aesthetics categories. To evaluate the usefulness of the AVRGG framework, we conducted four workshops (two with the AVRGG framework and two without) with novice game designers who generated 16 original AVR game concepts. Comparisons between the workshop groups, observations of the design sessions, focus groups, and surveys showed the promise and limitations of the AVRGG framework as a design tool. We found that novice designers were able to understand and apply the AVRGG framework after only a brief introduction. The observations indicated two primary challenges that AVR designers face: balancing the game between VR and non-VR player(s) and generating original game concepts. The AVRGG framework helped overcome the balancing concerns due to its ability to inspire novice game designers with example subgenres and draw attention to the asymmetric mechanics and competitive/cooperative nature of games. While half of those who used the AVRGG framework to design with created games that fit directly into existing subgenres, the other half viewed the subgenres as ``creative constraints'' useful in jumpstarting novel game designs that combined, modified, or purposefully avoided existing subgenres. Additional benefits and limitations of the AVRGG framework are outlined in the paper.},

This lack of interoperability limits the potential for widespread adoption and innovation in the blockchain space. While various initiatives aim to bridge this gap, many remain nascent. This paper addresses this issue by proposing a robust architecture and practical implementation to interconnect two Ethereum-based blockchains, enabling seamless smart contract interactions across these chains, and facilitating the exchange of complex information beyond mere token transfers. Our work explores the emerging landscape of Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocols, highlighting their current maturity and potential, and providing insights on how to overcome the technical hurdles associated with these protocols, particularly in the context of transmitting complex data and executing cross-chain function calls. Additionally, we tackle the challenges posed by linking private blockchains with public ones, ensuring secure and efficient data exchange. This paper aims to inspire blockchain researchers and practitioners, presenting a foundational framework for enhancing blockchain interoperability, including detailed, practical steps for its implementation. By laying the groundwork for more connected blockchain ecosystems, we intend to support the continued evolution and widespread adoption of blockchain technology.},

Other existing engagement in gaming monetization as well as digital asset ownership was also assessed. P2E interest was associated with higher gambling risk scores, but not with internet gaming disorder. P2E gamers also scored higher on extrinsic motivation and monetised gaming was generally associated with higher impulsivity. The results suggest that P2E may be attractive to those with a pre-existing interest in financially risky activities. Policy implications include the increasing need to monitor the growth of digital asset technology and the increasing convergence of gambling, financial speculation and gaming and the potential for increasing financial harm in gaming populations.},

  abstract = {Blockchains are peer-to-peer systems in which users can exchange digital assets without a central validation authority. It is a distributed ledger maintained through communication between the nodes of the network. It is a ledger on which all operations are recorded, which contributes to its transparency since every addition in the blockchain can be read by everyone and forever (as long as the network exists). Depending on the desired application, the proper functioning of the blockchain relies on three common pillars: (i) decentralization, (ii) security and (iii) scalability. A solution that would bring these three characteristics together is currently considered a utopia that is known as the blockchain trilemma, a belief that a crypto-currency must necessarily sacrifice one of these three pillars. During the course of this thesis, the issues at stake were quickly those of the quest for performance, particularly in terms of scalability without neglecting the other two aspects of the trilemma. We then started by studying Sycomore, an immutable and secure permisionless PoW blockchain with a graph-based structure. It is during the study of Sycomore that we propose Sycomore++, a blockchain protocol based on Sycomore whose main feature is to dynamically self-adapt the number of blocks created to the current number of transactions submitted. The results of this study have been published in the proceedings of peer-reviewed conferences. In a second step, after having shown the contribution of a classical graph-based solution in the blockchain trilemma, we looked at sharding solutions which, given their graph structure, seemed to us to be the most advanced graph-based solutions and the most promising in terms of scalability. It is in this context that we propose Yggdrasil, a state sharding solution for permisionless blockchains that supports both payment transactions and smart contracts. Yggdrasil allows for dynamic splitting and merging of shards by relying on decentralized mechanisms to assign nodes to shards in a secure manner. In this work, we also propose a new 2-Phase-Commit protocol to guarantee the execution of distributed smart contracts on different shards, even when shards dynamically reorganize. An experimental study confirms the ability of Yggdrasil to evolve and adapt to the transaction load with very promising performance, better than Sycomore++ in terms of scalability. Since the main benefit of state-sharding is to reduce communication and storage costs, solutions that implement it tend to scale more easily. Another advantage is its ability to maintain strong decentralization by empowering more nodes in separate shards without hindering its security. At the time of writing this manuscript, the results of this study on Yggdrasil have been submitted for publication to VLDB 2023 and a technical report presenting the results is available.},

Parties involved in the transaction maintain a multi-signature fraud-proof off-chain replicated state machine, and only resort to on-chain consensus when absolutely necessary (e.g., when two parties disagree on a state). Off-chain scaling is the only way to support fully scale-out decentralized applications ("dApps") with better privacy and no compromise on the trust and decentralization guarantees. It is the inflection point for blockchain mass adoption, and will be the engine behind all scalable dApps. Celer Network is an Internet-scale, trust-free, and privacy-preserving platform where everyone can quickly build, operate, and use highly scalable dApps. It is not a standalone blockchain but a networked system running on top of existing and future blockchains. It provides unprecedented performance and flexibility through innovation in off-chain scaling techniques and incentive-aligned cryptoeconomics. Celer Network embraces a layered architecture with clean abstractions that enable rapid evolution of each individual component, including a generalized state channel and sidechain suite that supports fast and generic off-chain state transitions; a provably optimal value transfer routing mechanism that achieves an order of magnitude higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art solutions; a powerful development framework and runtime for off-chain applications; and a new cryptoeconomic model that provides network effect, stable liquidity, and high availability for the off-chain ecosystem.},

Due to the programmer's lack of prior knowledge of the contract domain, SCs are ambiguous and error-prone. Several works, i.e., SPESC, Symboleo, and SmaCoNat, exist to support the legally-binding SCs. The aforementioned SCLs present intriguing approaches to building legally-binding SCs but either lack domain completeness, or are intended for non-collaborative business processes. In our previous work, we address the above-mentioned shortcomings of the XML-based smart-legal-contract markup language (SLCML), in which blockchain developers focus on the contractual workflow rather than the syntax specifics. However, SLCML, as a blockchain-independent formal specification language, is not evaluated to determine its applicability, usefulness, and usability for establishing legally-binding SCs for workflow enactment services (WES) to automate and streamline the business processes within connected organizations. In accordance with this, we formally implement the SLCML and propose evaluation approaches, such as running case and lab experiments, to demonstrate the SLCML's generality and applicability for developing legally-binding SCs. Overall, the results of this work ascertain the applicability, usefulness, and usability of the proposed SLCML for establishing legally-binding SCs for WES.},

However, ensuring their security is crucial due to their unchangeable nature, which makes them vulnerable to exploitation and errors. Neglecting security can lead to severe consequences such as financial losses and reputation damage. To address this, rigorous analytical processes are needed to evaluate Smart Contract security, despite challenges like cost and complexity associated with current tools. Following an empirical examination of current tools designed to identify vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts, this paper presents a robust and promising solution based on Machine Learning algorithms. The objective is to elevate the auditing and classification of Smart Contracts, building trust and confidence in Blockchain-based applications. By automating the security auditing process, the model not only reduces manual efforts and execution time but also ensures a comprehensive analysis, uncovering even the most complex security vulnerabilities that traditional tools may miss. Overall, the evaluation demonstrates that our proposed model surpasses conventional counterparts in terms of vulnerability detection performance, achieving an accuracy exceeding 98\% with optimized execution times.},

  abstract = {Blockchain technology, initially developed as the underlying structure for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, has evolved to become a foundational tool for secure, transparent, and decentralized transactions across a wide array of industries. One of the most promising applications of blockchain technology is the use of smart contracts, self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into lines of code. These technologies offer significant potential for reducing transaction costs, increasing transparency, and mitigating fraud, which is crucial in sectors such as finance, supply chain management, healthcare, and legal services. Blockchain provides a decentralized and immutable ledger system where all transactions are recorded in a way that is secure and tamper-resistant. This feature makes it highly valuable for industries that rely on trust, such as banking, real estate, and logistics. The decentralized nature of blockchain eliminates the need for intermediaries, reducing transaction times and costs while ensuring data integrity. As a result, blockchain-based systems can offer higher security, traceability, and accountability compared to traditional centralized systems. Smart contracts take the concept of blockchain a step further by automating contract execution. These self-executing contracts automatically carry out actions based on predefined conditions without requiring human intervention. For instance, in a financial transaction, a smart contract could automatically transfer funds from one party to another when certain criteria are met, such as the delivery of goods or services. This process is efficient, transparent, and reduces the possibility of disputes, as all actions are recorded on the blockchain and cannot be altered. One of the primary advantages of smart contracts is their ability to increase transparency and reduce fraud. Since the contract's code and the terms are available to all relevant parties and cannot be changed once the contract is deployed, the chances of manipulation or errors are minimized. Furthermore, smart contracts are executed automatically, ensuring that both parties fulfill their obligations in real-time, without delay or the need for third-party validation. However, while blockchain and smart contracts offer numerous benefits, there are challenges in their widespread adoption. These include scalability concerns, regulatory uncertainties, technical complexity, and the need for legal frameworks to govern smart contracts. Blockchain systems also require significant computational resources, which could limit their efficiency, especially in cases of high transaction volumes. This paper explores the potential of blockchain and smart contracts for secure and transparent transactions, analyzing their benefits, challenges, and real-world applications. It examines how various sectors are integrating these technologies into their business models and the evolving legal and regulatory landscape. The paper concludes by discussing future trends, such as the integration of blockchain with emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things (IoT), and how they may further enhance the security, transparency, and automation of transactions.},

However, its scalability challenges and the need for significant computational power may limit its widespread adoption in high-volume e-commerce environments. Scalable storage solutions, such as cloud-based databases and distributed storage systems, are evaluated for their ability to handle large and dynamic datasets typical of e-commerce platforms. These technologies provide flexibility, cost-efficiency, and the capability to scale with the growing demands of online businesses. However, they also introduce new challenges in terms of data consistency, latency, and the need for robust disaster recovery mechanisms. The study further delves into advanced cyber defense strategies, which are essential in protecting e-commerce platforms from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. These strategies include the integration of AI-driven threat detection, encryption, and multi-factor authentication systems. The analysis highlights how these cyber defense measures can be integrated with both blockchain and scalable storage solutions to create a comprehensive security framework.

  abstract = {The concept of the Massive Multiplayer Online (MMO) game is well established, with several multimillion euro productions (such as World of Warcraft and Eve Online) demonstrating the appeal of the genre. Yet few, if any, of these games bring any aspect of real-time, real-world data into the game. Sporting events, such as the Barcelona World Race sailing regatta, increasingly provide such live real time data, which can be integrated within a game environment to create a MMO competition between 'virtual' competitors and 'real' competitors. This paper presents the planning, design, implementation and overview of an educational MMO game to accompany the Barcelona World Race 2010/2011, and discusses the differences in design and implementation for games of this type. Keywords-component; MMO games, events, races I. BARCELONA WORLD RACE 2010/2011 - THE GAME The Barcelona World Race is one of the world's highest profile sailing races. During the regatta, a series of double- handed (two-crew) sailing vessels sail non-stop around the world, competing to see who can arrive back in Barcelona in the shortest period of time. Although some outside assistance is permitted, this is subject to a series of regulations and penalties - the overriding goal of the regatta is to enable teams to sail independently around the world, without stopping for supplies or repairs. Almost all large sailing regattas have embraced multimedia as a method with which to promote and publicise the race. In recent years, running a parallel 'virtual' regatta - essentially an online multiplayer videogame, allowing players to 'sail' a virtual boat and compete against other real players - has become an essential part of the promotional effort of every regatta. These MMO (Massive Multiplayer Online) have now become so successful that they have become an expected addition to all regattas. For the Barcelona World Race 2010/2011, the race organisers, la Fundaci{\'o} per a la Navegaci{\'o} Oceanica de Barcelona (FNOB), one criticism of the existing games in market was the lack of a true relationship between the game and the real event, especially with regards to the possibility of running the game in parallel the event, during the same time frame. FNOB's desire was to commision a game that attempted to mimic the real event as closely as possible, and provide some form of tracking of the real-boats' progress. To this extent, they commissioned the development of a game that would: 1. Research new methodologies of gameplay that allow an MMO sailing game to run successfully in conjunction with a live event (particularly, the Barcelona World Race 2010/2011). 2. Develop educational components that would draw in new players to world of sailing, and attempt to educate players on several of the key issues currently facing the maritime environment.},

However, the endless growth of Blockchain data keeps challenging the storage capacity of Blockchain nodes, compromising decentralization, and revealing the issue that the state-of-the-art storage systems of Blockchain are not scalable. From the perspective of improving the scalability of Blockchain storage systems, this paper introduces the logical and physical data structure used by Blockchain storage systems, surveys the current schemes of Blockchain storage systems in terms of the approaches to reducing data redundancy, the corresponding influence on its degree of decentralization and data reliability, and conducts quantitative analysis on data redundancy for schemes of Blockchain storage systems. The study finds that the key to realizing scalable Blockchain storage systems is to deal with the contradiction between data redundancy and its decentralization characteristic. Based on the findings, the node-based scalable model for Blockchain storage systems (SMBSS) is proposed, experimental analysis on the prototypes of the SMBSS is carried out to verify its validity, and future directions for scalable Blockchain storage systems are concluded.},

The lack of research and public understanding of its benefits and drawbacks prompted the researchers to investigate its market. As such, the study tried to look into the risks and benefits of crypto gaming if it would be regulated by the government, and how market volatility influences the churn rate of crypto games. Method -- The research used a descriptive study to determine the perception of people who are engaged in playing ``Axie Infinity''. The research also used non-probability sampling using the snowball method. The only tool used to collect data was Google Forms. Furthermore, the study used Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) to analyze the descriptive data. Result -- The results showed that most players spend their time playing Axie Infinity for about 1 to 4 hours a day. Predominantly, the return of investments for playing the game will take about 1 to 3 months. It also showed that these players agreed that there is a possible financial instability in a volatile market. With this, they have a high trust issue in terms of price manipulation, privacy and security, and its design and usability. Conclusion -- Understanding the cryptocurrency market requires comprehending the perspective of the people who are engaged in a play-to-earn game, and their concerns are critical for any government actions aimed at regulating self-employed income earners playing (Non-fungible Tokens) NFT games in the Philippines. Recommendations -- It is suggested that further research must be conducted to understand how self-employed Filipino income earners comprehend NFT gaming and cryptocurrency, impacting their level of interest and participation. Research Implications -- Taxing NFT games without sound regulatory frameworks may result in the disarray of this alternative income source. Therefore, the government must tread carefully to avoid a market collapse or other unfavorable outcomes.},

This study proposes a framework that integrates game mechanics---leveling systems, badges, and timely feedback---with artificial intelligence (AI)-driven personalization to meet the challenges of enhanced adaptability, motivation, and learning outcomes in online environments. Key design elements were identified through literature reviews and consultations with instructional design experts, leading to the development an adaptive learning platform prototype. The prototype underwent an eight-week pilot study with 250 Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University (PSAU) students randomly assigned to a control group (non-adaptive system) or an experimental group (adaptive system). Data sources included pre- and post-tests, platform engagement analytics, and learner perception surveys. The results showed that the adaptive group outperformed the control group in the post-test scores (M = 85.2, SD = 6.4 vs. M = 78.5, SD = 7.2) and motivation levels (M = 4.2, SD = 0.7 vs. M = 3.6, SD = 0.8). Additionally, 82\% of the adaptive group achieved mastery-level performance compared to 64\% in the control group. These findings demonstrate the potential of integrating game mechanics and AI-driven personalization to transform digital learning, offering a roadmap for scalable, data-driven adaptive platforms.

Structural equation modeling was applied to analyse the collected data.,The results indicated that seven of nine research hypotheses were supported. It was found that trust, perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment and perceived ease of use were key determinants for users' behavioural intention to use blockchain-based games. The most influential relationship in the research model appeared to be the effect of perceived usefulness on users' behavioural intention to use blockchain-based games. However, subjective norms did not have significant positive impacts on users' behavioural intention to use blockchain-based games.,The regulatory support from governmental authorities is essential to provide additional legal certainty to build users' trust in playing blockchain-based games. Blockchain-based games providers should arrange the training program targeted to the general users to enhance their understanding of the key features associated with blockchain-based games. Blockchain-based games developers should come up with good design solutions to maximize user enjoyment with blockchain-based games by considering additional entertainment elements.,To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is first of its kind in investigating the adoption of blockchain-based games from users' perspectives.

The NFT infringement incidents in recent years have exposed many issues, such as lack of government regulation, imperfect copyright protection mechanisms, and illegal profits from service platforms. Considering the collusive behavior during the NFT minting process, this study uses evolutionary game theory to model a game composed of three populations: digital content creators; NFT service platforms; and government regulatory agencies. We derived and analyzed the replication dynamics of the game to determine the evolutionary stability strategy. In addition, combined with numerical simulations, we also analyzed the impact of individual factors on the stability of system evolution. This study identifies that the incentives and fines set by the government must be above a certain threshold in order for game results to develop toward an ideal equilibrium state, and the government can try to improve the efficiency of obtaining and updating market information and set dynamic punishment and reward mechanisms based on this. This study also found that excessive rewards are not conducive to the government fulfilling its own regulatory responsibilities. In this regard, the government can use information technology to reduce the cost of regulation, thereby partially offsetting the costs brought about by incentive mechanisms. In addition, the government can also enhance the governance participation of platforms and creators to improve the robustness of digital copyright protection by strengthening media construction and cultivating public copyright awareness. This study helps to understand the complex relationship between NFT service platforms, digital content creators, and government regulatory authorities and proves the practical meaning of countermeasures and suggestions for improving government digital copyright regulations.},

  abstract = {Blockchain, or distributed ledger, provides a way to build various decentralized systems without relying on any single trusted party. This is especially attractive for smart contracts, that different parties do not need to trust each other to have a contract, and the distributed ledger can guarantee correct execution of the contract. Most existing distributed ledger based smart contract systems process smart contracts in a serial manner, i.e., all users have to run a contract before its result can be accepted by the system. Although this approach is easy to implement and manage, it is not scalable and greatly limits the system's capability of handling a large number of smart contracts. In order to address this problem, we propose a scalable smart contract execution scheme that can run multiple smart contract in parallel to improve throughput of the system. Our scheme relies on two key techniques: a fair contract partition algorithm leveraging integer linear programming to partition a set of smart contracts into multiple subsets, and a random assignment protocol assigning subsets randomly to a subgroup of users. We prove that, our scheme is secure as long as more than 50\% of the computational power is possessed by honest nodes. We then conduct experiments with data from existing smart contract system to evaluate the efficiency of our scheme. The results demonstrate that our approach is scalable and much more efficient than the existing smart contract platform.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Although blockchain technology and smart contracts are garnering attention in various sectors, their applications and familiarity within the realm of radiology remain largely unexplored. Blockchain, a decentralized digital ledger technology, offers secure, transparent, and resilient data management by distributing the verification process across a network of independent entities. This decentralized technology presents a possible solution for a range of healthcare challenges, from secure data transfer to automated verification processes. To address such challenges in the context of medical imaging, blockchain could provide different approaches, including smart contracts, machine learning algorithms, and the secure dissemination of large files among key stakeholders such as patients, healthcare providers, and institutions. This manuscript aims to explore the current attitudes and perspectives of trainees and radiologists to the utilization of blockchain technology and smart contracts in clinical radiology. Additionally, the study provides an in-depth analysis of the potential applications for incorporating blockchain into radiology. Methods: After obtaining The George Washington University Committee on Human Research Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, we conducted a 10-question survey among radiologists and trainees at several institutions and private practices. Surveys were created via the Google Forms application and were emailed to potential participants. Participants were asked about their current academic level (medical student, resident/fellow, academic radiologist, private practice radiologist, others), their knowledge level about the field of imaging informatics and blockchain and smart contract technologies, their level of interest in learning more about blockchain and smart contracts, and their opinion about possible applications of blockchain and smart contract in the future of medical imaging. Results: A total of 118 survey requests were distributed; 83 were returned, reflecting a 70.3\% overall response rate. Of these, 19 were sent to private practices with a 15.8\% response rate (3/19), and 99 to academic centers, yielding an 80.8\% response rate (80/99). The survey respondents demonstrated a strong interest and need to further understand these technologies among radiologists and trainees. This study focuses on key components of this technology as it relates to healthcare and the practice of radiology, including data storage, patient care, secure communication, and automation, as well as strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis. Discussion: To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate and establish a baseline for the current perspectives on the application of blockchain technology and smart contracts in clinical radiology amongst trainees and radiologists across academic and private settings. Incorporating blockchain and smart contracts technologies into the field of radiology has the potential to achieve greater efficiency, security, and patient empowerment. However, the adoption of this technology comes with challenges, such as infrastructure, interoperability, scalability, and regulatory compliance. Collaboration between radiologists, hospital administration, policymakers, technology developers, and patient advocacy organizations will help guide and advance our understanding of the potential applications of blockchain and smart contracts in radiology and healthcare.},

  abstract = {The integration of blockchain technology and smart contracts presents a transformative opportunity in healthcare financing by enabling the creation and trading of futures contracts based on the value of medical innovations. Traditional financial mechanisms struggle to capture the downstream savings generated by new therapies, particularly as insurers and health systems face the challenge of managing short-term costs while realizing long-term health benefits. Blockchain's decentralized, transparent, and tamper-proof infrastructure offers a solution by providing reliable data that tracks health outcomes, cost savings, and patient behavior in real-time. This paper explores how a blockchain-governed healthcare marketplace can facilitate the trading of Health Impact Futures (HIF) contracts that allow stakeholders---such as self-insured health plans, insurers, biotech firms, and speculators---to hedge risks, capture savings, and invest in medical innovations. By leveraging smart contracts, which automate transactions and ensure trust through pre-defined algorithms, the platform offers a seamless and secure environment for managing complex healthcare data and financial instruments. The introduction of health cost indices, anchored in reliable blockchain-verified data, allows for accurate pricing and risk management, promoting liquidity and market efficiency. Additionally, tokenization of health savings enables insurers to capture the economic value of improved health outcomes, even when patients switch health plans. This approach not only ensures the continuity of value but also introduces a new financial layer that reflects the real-world impact of medical innovations. By using structured notes and algorithm-driven health indices, market participants can dynamically hedge against fluctuations in healthcare costs while aligning incentives across the healthcare value chain. The paper concludes by addressing the technological, regulatory, and data integrity challenges associated with developing a blockchain-based futures market for healthcare and proposes a roadmap for overcoming these barriers to unlock the full potential of this innovation.},

  abstract = {In 2021, the concept of NFTs gained worldwide attention when a digital artist known as `Beeple' sold his work Everydays: The First 5000 Days for 69 million US dollars at Christie's, placing him among the top three living artists by sale value (Kastrenakes 2021). Since then, ``non-fungible token'' (or ``NFT'') has rapidly become a high-scoring term on Google Trends and there has been corresponding growth in the number of artists, collectors, and platforms dealing with NFTs.Because of the many NFT platforms, the enormous volume of NFTs, the involvement of various cryptocurrencies, the fluctuating prices, and unpredictability of trends, navigating the NFT art market is very complicated. In an attempt to engage in this new sphere of speculation (and to speculate about it), we opened a physical NFT Shop at an abandoned gas station. Besides NFT art, we offered conversation and warm coffee to visitors. Surprisingly, we found almost everyone we met had heard about NFTs, although few demonstrated any in-depth knowledge. Our NFT Shop was expressly concerned with displaying only `clean' NFTs, thereby underlining the environmental impact of typical blockchain technology. Tezos, a cryptocurrency known as a clean and eco-friendly `crypto', is gaining popularity in the NFT art market as an alternative to Ethereum, which has a high carbon footprint (McDonald 2021) and high minting cost. According to Memo Akten's A guide to eco-friendly CryptoArt, the cost of transactions in Ethereum fluctuates between \$100-\$1000 (Akten 2021), which is in stark contrast to Tezos, where exchange fees are currently below a dollar. The high energy consumption of blockchain has generated strong opposition, especially among artists. Thus, many alternative NFT platforms such as objkt and fx(hash) use Tezos and brand themselves as an eco-friendly and affordable marketplaces.Despite the availability of relatively clean cryptos, many digital artists prefer not to be associated with CryptoArt of any kind. At the same time, the general audience for art largely assumes that all digital art is NFT art. From the perspective of digital artists, it is difficult to say whether NFTs are a blessing or a curse. On the one hand, the art market has become receptive to digital formats, so many artists now have the opportunity to make a living from their art. On the other hand, there remains much that seems `unclean' about NFT markets, although all transactions are entirely transparent. In this context, this paper and our art project NFT Shop aim to offer a framework for making sense of the NFT marketplaces and thus help to demystify the concepts of NFT and related platforms.},

ABSTRACT Purpose- Blockchain technology, which is one of the newest technologies, offers an unchangeable, transparent, and reliable data management infrastructure. Crypto assets, the use of which is rapidly becoming widespread with blockchain technology, are changing the dynamics of many traditional industries. NFTs, one of the crypto asset types, have started to become widespread in the art industry very quickly, especially as of 2020. A global application in the music industry regarding blockchain technology and NFT applications, which has the potential to cause a significant transformation at the intersection of the art industry with digital technologies, was first implemented in 2021. In this article, a literature review is made on the advantages and disadvantages of the use of NFTs in the music industry, and a discussion is presented on the first application. With this research article, it is aimed to contribute to the academic literature in this interdisciplinary field, which is at the intersection of technology, art and marketing disciplines by discussing the future potential of NFT applications. Methodology- In the article, secondary source scanning and sample usage were examined as a method. Secondary sources used includes books, articles, and online publications on blockchain technology and NFTs. A first and global NFT project applied in the music industry is examined and discussed with literature review findings. Findings- NFT applications in the music industry have advantages in the areas of proof of uniqueness, copyrights, new business models, digital integration, and security. The fact that NFTs depend on the blockchain infrastructure they are developed, privacy issues, difficulties in user experience, and lack of legal regulations are the findings defined as disadvantages of NFTs. Conclusion- The use of NFT applications in the music industry and related products and services, which do not have many resources in the academic literature, has been examined through publications and internet resources, and a sample application. While there are innovations and benefits that come with the implementation of NFTs, there are also obstacles to the implementation of these applications. This article presents a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of using NFTs in the music industry and contributes to the Turkish academic literature. The results of the widespread use of NFTs, which have the potential to provide significant advantages in the music industry, should be followed and supported by research. Keywords: Blockchain technology, bitcoin, NFT, art, music industry.},

In recent three years, NFT (Non-Fungible Token), as an emerging product based on blockchain technology, has made a name for itself in the international field of vision, and in domestic incarnation of a more localized concept of digital collectibles known to consumers, and at one time, there was a burst of fire within the public figures. However, due to its rapid development and dissemination, the theoretical level of the research lag is obvious, most of the domestic exploration of NFT digital collectibles are still in the legal level and the artistic level of the basic definition, for the practical significance of its has in the field of commercial marketing is not fully in-depth, as a strong correlation with the brand as a product of the impact of the mechanism has not yet been elucidated. Therefore, this paper proposes the effect of NFT digital collection attributes on brand co-creation in the field of branding, introducing perceived value as a mediator variable and brand attitude as a moderating variable, in order to explore its clear inner mechanism path.},

Smart contracts enable users to manage significant asset amounts of finances on the blockchain without the involvement of any intermediaries. The conditions and checks that have been written in smart contract and executed to the application cannot be changed again. However, these unique features pose some other risks to the smart contract. Smart contracts have several flaws in its programmable language and methods of execution, despite being a developing technology. To build smart contracts and implement numerous complicated business logics, high-level languages are used by the developers to code smart contracts. Thus, blockchain smart contract is the most important element of any decentralized application, posing the risk for it to be attacked. So, the presence of vulnerabilities are to be taken care of on a priority basis. It is important for detection of vulnerabilities in a smart contract and only then implement and connect it with applications to ensure security of funds. The motive of the paper is to discuss how deep learning may be utilized to deliver bug-free secure smart contracts. Objective of the paper is to detect three kinds of vulnerabilities- reentrancy, timestamp and infinite loop. A deep learning model has been created for detection of smart contract vulnerabilities using graph neural networks. The performance of this model has been compared to the present automated tools and other independent methods. It has been shown that this model has greater accuracy than other methods while comparing the prediction of smart contract vulnerabilities in existing models.},

Blockchain and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) share a symbiotic relationship, with blockchain serving as the underlying technology that empowers NFTs to function as unique digital assets. NFTs, on the other hand, leverage blockchain technology to address the longstanding challenge of proving ownership and authenticity in the digital realm. By representing unique assets on the blockchain, NFTs solve the problem of digital scarcity, enabling artists, musicians, game developers, and creators to tokenize and sell their digital creations as limited-edition, one-of-a-kind items. The indivisibility of NFTs ensures that each token represents a whole and unique piece of content, be it digital art, music, videos, or virtual real estate. This paper is reviewing the world famous NFT that are traded on popular Blockchain on world famous NFT market place such as Opensea and YoungParrot.

Software refactoring, in particular, is considered an important and useful quality-assurance technique, but due to the perceived difficulties and risks of performing it, often neglected in practice. Still, it received little attention by software engineering education and training so far. Games are a popular means for fostering motivation as well as mediating and improving practical competences by providing an enjoyable and playful environment. However, for instructors it is challenging to develop and apply game designs that address certain learning objectives, which is important for integrating the game into existing or planned learning and training paths, e.g., in the framework of university courses or training units for (experienced) software developers. In this paper, we propose an ontology that aims to support the analysis and design of games in the field of software refactoring. We apply a structured process for creating a unifying domain ontology bridging core concepts from three related fields, i.e. game design (a), software refactoring (b), and competence management (c). The resulting ontology is then represented as a meta-model in terms of a UML class diagram and reflects concepts important for refactoring-game designs. We describe ontology-based options for game design and illustrate the use of the ontology by analyzing existing refactoring-gaming approaches. In addition, we reflect applying the ontology for reasoning about novel game designs and discuss further potential of the approach.},

The expected metaverse should be a realistic society with more direct and physical interactions, while the concepts of race, gender, and even physical disability would be weakened, which would be highly beneficial for society. However, the development of metaverse is still in its infancy, with great potential for improvement. Regarding metaverse's huge potential, industry has already come forward with advance preparation, accompanied by feverish investment, but there are few discussions about metaverse in academia to scientifically guide its development. In this paper, we highlight the representative applications for social good. Then we propose a three-layer metaverse architecture from a macro perspective, containing infrastructure, interaction, and ecosystem. Moreover, we journey toward both a historical and novel metaverse with a detailed timeline and table of specific attributes.

  abstract = {Environmental negotiations are complex, and conveying the interaction between science and policy in traditional teaching methods is challenging. To address this issue, innovative educational approaches like serious gaming and role-playing games have emerged. These methods allow students to actively explore the roles of different stakeholders in environmental decision-making and weigh for instance between sometimes conflicting UN Sustainable Development Goals or other dilemmas. In this work the phosphorus negotiation game (P-Game) is for the first time introduced. We present the initial quantitative and qualitative findings derived from engaging 788 students at various academic levels (Bachelor, Master, PhD, and Postdoc) across three continents and spanning 22 different countries. Quantitative results indicate that female participants and MSc students benefitted the most significantly from the P-Game, with their self-reported knowledge about phosphorus science and negotiation science/practice increasing by 71--93\% (overall), 86--100\% (females), and 73--106\% (MSc students in general). Qualitative findings reveal that the P-Game can be smoothly conducted with students from diverse educational and cultural backgrounds. Moreover, students highly value their participation in the P-Game, which can be completed in just 2--3 h. This game not only encourages active engagement among participants but also provides valuable insights into the complex environmental issues associated with global phosphorus production. We strongly believe that the underlying methodology described here could also be used for other topics.},

Due to the differences in the data structure, interface protocols, consensus mechanisms, and even business models, new "chain silos" have been formed among blockchain applications, which limit the interoperability of asset exchange and business collaboration among blockchains. Based on the full analysis of blockchain technology characteristics and blockchain Internet development needs, this paper designs a blockchain cross-chain system based on the unified NFT identity identification technology, address tracking technology, and seamless interconnection of mobile security cross-chain technology, based on the "NFT + Cross-chain bridge". Based on the service mode, verification mode, and security of Bridges, six model timeliness, smart contract robustness, and convergence radius were selected from 44 cross-chain Bridges for experimental verification. Finally, it is concluded that the overall performance of the blockchain cross-chain system based on "NFT + Cross-chain bridge" is far more universal and better security than the performance of ordinary Bridges.},

  abstract = {Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) offer a unique method for representing digital and physical assets on the blockchain. However, the NFT market has recently experienced a downturn in interest, mainly due to challenges related to high entry barriers and limited market liquidity. Fractionalization emerges as a promising solution, allowing multiple parties to hold a stake in a single NFT. By breaking down ownership into fractional shares, this approach lowers the entry barrier for investors, enhances market liquidity, and democratizes access to valuable digital assets. Despite these benefits, the current landscape of NFT fractionalization is fragmented, with no standardized framework to guide the secure and interoperable implementation of fractionalization mechanisms. This paper contributions are twofold: first, we provide a detailed analysis of the current NFT fractionalization landscape focusing on security challenges; second, we introduce a standardized approach that addresses these challenges, paving the way for more secure, interoperable, and accessible NFT fractionalization platforms.},

Blockchain enabled IoT networks, due to their immutability, transparency, and accountability, are commonly employed to ensure safe and secure implementation of the IoT networks. However, blockchain technology is prone to degradation in performance and efficiency in the presence of large number of IoT devices and massive data generated by these networks and does not scale well with the growing size of the networks. This research proposes a Scalable EdgeIoT Blockchain (SEB) framework using EOSIO to enhance the performance and efficiency of the blockchain enabled IoT networks. The proposed framework leverages upon the concepts of sharding for parallel execution of smart contracts, Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) for consensus in the network with large number of devices and Interplanetary File System (IPFS) for the data storage and management of massive data in the IoT networks. The proposed framework is implemented in the EOSIO blockchain. This study experiments show significant improvement in the throughput, latency and resource utilization compared to the state-of-the-art solutions in the blockchain enabled IoT networks.},

One such application is online gaming. Blockchain offers participants the ability to verify the fairness of games in a manner previously unattainable by the classical centralized approach. However, the introduction of blockchain incurs additional overhead and poses unique challenges necessary to overcome in order to be a viable alternative. The transparency blockchain provides opens potential avenues for collusion, particularly in multiplayer games, which must be addressed. Furthermore, the emulation of random state, a core component of online gaming, is rendered difficult in a decentralized context. No approach exists which manages random state for multiplayer gaming in a completely decentralized manner. We propose a novel approach toward this end, significantly extending the utility of blockchain technology to online gaming.},

Scalability has been identified as a major challenge in large-scale blockchain networks because of the number of possible participants. Scalability becomes a consideration because the blockchain distributed ledger is replicated at all participating nodes, and the block validation process may experience transaction throughput, storage, latency, and energy consumption hurdles. Sharding is a database technique adopted in blockchain technology to attempt to resolve the scalability issue. Sharding enables parallelization of transactions to improve transaction throughput in a blockchain network where a single ledger is shared in each shard to optimize the storage issue of blockchain scalability. Herein, we present a detailed review focusing on scalability challenges in blockchain and solutions provided by database sharding to resolve these challenges. Various sharding consensus protocols are examined along with our insights into existing solutions. Extensive open challenges are provided in this research for future researchers, including cross-shard communication overhead, shard formation, node assignment to shards, optimal number of shards in a network and shard takeover attacks.},

It is required to ensure that everyone is getting a fair share of medical supplies without unnecessary waste. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution that ensures the commitment and accountability of all participants to prevent them from producing any unnecessary waste. We introduce five phases, such as registration, commitment, production, delivery, and consumption, to perform the waste assessment accurately and fairly. We develop four smart contracts that ensure data provenance, transparency, security, and accountability while recording all actions on an immutable ledger automatically. We utilize offchain decentralized storage to deal with the large data problem. We present five algorithms and discuss each phase of the proposed solution, along with their full implementation, testing, and validation details. We conduct the security analysis to ensure that our smart contracts are secure enough and they do not have vulnerabilities and flaws. The smart contracts code is made publicly available on GitHub.},

  abstract = {The discipline of Games Design has surged in popularity in higher education as a route to industry for aspiring game developers. Notably, at the time of writing 138 UK Universities are now offering game design degrees, and many further education institutions. This growth is not only in volume but also in the diversity of students who enrol in these courses. Young learners, coming from various backgrounds and with differing levels of professional and academic experience, are drawn to games as a field of study. Games disciplines (such as Games Art, Design, and Programming) are often seen as more accessible than their comparative parent disciplines (such as Computer Science). This diversity presents both an opportunity and a challenge for educators: to develop teaching methodologies that not only cater to a wide range of experiences but also effectively prepare students for the creative and technical demands of the games industry. This paper introduces a pioneering design concept utilized in the pedagogy of game design, namely the use of game frameworks. A framework is a structure built in a video games engine, containing a pre-made, playable game experience, which students are taught to build upon and modify. Frameworks abstract and modularise fundamental, complex elements of the game creation process, allowing new learners to quickly become engaged with the iterative process of designing gameplay. It also allows educators to focus on a specific area of interest. For example, a student can focus just on the UI elements of the game for a whole module of study, without needing to have built the entire game first. This allows students to focus on the elements being taught, without introducing a significant amount of non-assessed content just to enable to learning. This position paper discusses our application of this approach, including the process of framework design, supportive assessment, successes and challenges.},

Through a thorough examination of existing literature, we delve into the integration of LLMs into various aspects of blockchain security. We explore the mechanisms through which LLMs can bolster blockchain security, including their applications in smart contract auditing, transaction anomaly detection, vulnerability repair, program analysis of smart contracts, and serving as participants in the cryptocurrency community. Furthermore, we assess the challenges and limitations associated with leveraging LLMs for enhancing blockchain security, considering factors such as scalability, privacy concerns, and ethical concerns.

Despite the availability of numerous smart contract vulnerability detection tools, many face challenges such as slow updates, usability issues, and limited installation methods. These challenges hinder the adoption and practicality of these tools. This paper examines smart contract vulnerability detection tools from 2016 to 2023, sourced from the Web of Science (WOS) and Google Scholar. By systematically collecting, screening, and synthesizing relevant research, 38 open-source tools that provide installation methods were selected for further investigation. From a developer's perspective, this paper offers a comprehensive survey of these 38 open-source tools, discussing their operating principles, installation methods, environmental dependencies, update frequencies, and installation challenges. Based on this, we propose an Ethereum smart contract vulnerability detection framework. This framework enables developers to easily utilize various detection tools and accurately analyze contract security issues. To validate the framework's stability, over 1700 h of testing were conducted. Additionally, a comprehensive performance test was performed on the mainstream detection tools integrated within the framework, assessing their hardware requirements and vulnerability detection coverage. Experimental results indicate that the Slither tool demonstrates satisfactory performance in terms of system resource consumption and vulnerability detection coverage. This study represents the first performance evaluation of testing tools in this domain, providing significant reference value.},

To address this issue, we propose the FLPShard model, a method that transforms the sharding problem into a single-source capacitated facility location problem (SSCFLP). FLPShard can handle multiple constraints simultaneously and allows multiple nodes to be bundled and allocated as a whole, meeting the demands of IIoT. By constructing neighborhoods during the dynamic adjustment process, we achieve dynamic incremental updates and automatic splitting of blockchain shards. We evaluated FLPShard by building a system prototype, and the results show that, compared to random sharding algorithms, FLPShard significantly increases system throughput and greatly reduces transaction latency.},

Using facilities of Ethereum Network and solidity programing, we have created an Agri non-fungible token (NFT) according to ERC-721 protocol that is most widely used protocol for creating NFTs on Ethereum. One of the main advantages of ERC-721 is its flexibility, as it allows developers to define custom metadata for each NFT and customize the attributes. The interaction between Ethereum nodes and the user is established via the frontend, which is developed in Nodejs and connects to the Ethereum network. In previous works on loyalty systems, blockchain-based solutions were proposed that resemble the system developed in this study but there are significant differences between our work and other related works such as: the use of NFT and personalization for customers, the adoption of a new version of Solidity, as well as the adoption of the metadata feature for using media to encourage and assist customer brand awareness and repurchase. We tried to provide a safe and transparent way to use NFTs in the way of increasing brand loyalty in agricultural businesses. Due to characters of NFTs as uniqueness and personalization, customers in a loyalty cycle prefer to shop more in order to earn more AgriNFT, causing retailer to sell more items and manufacturers to generate more goods.},

  abstract = {Blockchain technology, initially developed for the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, has expanded its reach into various sectors, such as supply chain management, healthcare, and real estate. The technology's transparency, and security have led many to view it as self-auditing. On the other hand, as blockchain integrates into traditional business models, the necessity for formal auditing processes akin to those in the nonblockchain corporate (business) world becomes evident and highly important. The present research explores the hesitancy among audit firms (statutory auditors) to engage in blockchain auditing, delving into the technological, regulatory, and inherent risks that make blockchain a challenging terrain for auditors and their work. The present research outlines the evolution of the blockchain environment, detailing its historical progression and diverse platforms. This finding underscores the crucial role of auditing in ensuring transparency, trust, and corporate (business) sustainability. The challenges faced by audit firms in the blockchain space, including technical complexities, regulatory ambiguities, and inherent risks such as cryptocurrency market volatility/risk, are extensively discussed. Practical case studies such as those of DAO attack, QuadrigaCX's missing funds, and the scrutiny of Bitfinex and Tether illustrate the consequences of inadequate auditing in blockchain platforms. Potential solutions for these challenges have been put forth, with an emphasis on the following: collaborative learning and training, advocacy for regulatory clarity, technological advancements, and the development of auditing standards specific to blockchain. The study culminates by emphasising the consequences of audit firms' ongoing reluctance towards blockchain technology and the advantages that can be gained by surmounting these obstacles. The aforementioned discovery implies that a mutually beneficial association between auditors and the blockchain industry may usher in an unprecedented epoch characterised by enhanced market economy transparency, confidence, and ingenuity. A comparison of conventional and blockchain auditing methods is presented in the appendices, with an emphasis on the distinctions between the two approaches.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the rationality of large language models (LLMs) in strategic decision-making contexts, specifically within the framework of game theory. We evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs across a spectrum of complete-information and incomplete-information games. Our findings reveal that LLMs frequently deviate from rational strategies, particularly as the complexity of the game increases with larger payoff matrices or deeper sequential trees. To address these limitations, we design multiple game-theoretic workflows that guide the reasoning and decision-making processes of LLMs. These workflows aim to enhance the models' ability to compute Nash Equilibria and make rational choices, even under conditions of uncertainty and incomplete information. Experimental results demonstrate that the adoption of these workflows significantly improves the rationality and robustness of LLMs in game-theoretic tasks. Specifically, with the workflow, LLMs exhibit marked improvements in identifying optimal strategies, achieving near-optimal allocations in negotiation scenarios, and reducing susceptibility to exploitation during negotiations. Furthermore, we explore the meta-strategic considerations of whether it is rational for agents to adopt such workflows, recognizing that the decision to use or forgo the workflow constitutes a game-theoretic issue in itself. Our research contributes to a deeper understanding of LLMs' decision-making capabilities in strategic contexts and provides insights into enhancing their rationality through structured workflows. The findings have implications for the development of more robust and strategically sound AI agents capable of navigating complex interactive environments.

In 2017, two interesting applications emerged on Ethereum, CryptonPunks, and CryptonKitties, As CryptonKitties is an example, each kitty has a unique DNA number, taking on a different appearance and temperament. These two applications have revolutionary significance for the non-fungible token proposal and practical scenario application. In this experiment, We used the Ethereum platform in the Solidity language to implement a set of digital currency systems based on NFT. It's named CoinCoin.Smart contracts are the way we implement all the functions. Through the smart contract, it can realize its minting, trading, and other functions. The implementation of functions will be simulated on the Remix platform. Mastering NFT's smart contract could be able to provide a new ecosystem for the encryption industry and have a profound impact on the digital asset across multiple industries, such as games, art, and digital assets. Our system can provide a reference for the implementation of the NFT smart contract and bring experiences for the further deeper research.},

Since gamification is often used in service design, it is important that the concept be brought in line with the service literature. So far, though, there has been a dearth of such literature. This article is an attempt to tie in gamification with service marketing theory, which conceptualizes the consumer as a co-producer of the service. It presents games as service systems composed of operant and operand resources. It proposes a definition for gamification, one that emphasizes its experiential nature. The definition highlights four important aspects of gamification: affordances, psychological mediators, goals of gamification and the context of gamification. Using the definition the article identifies four possible gamifying actors and examines gamification as communicative staging of the service environment.},

  abstract = {The objective of this thesis project was to implement a process to collect player behaviour data for mobile game development. The company was a hypercasual mobile games developer based in Helsinki. The implementation of the process to collect player behaviour data for mobile game development is meant to align with the strategy and mission that the company adopted in 2018 for developing hypercasual mobile games and support the company's stakeholders in their need for informed decision-making.      The video games industry has a shorter history compared to other media-based industries. Moreover, mobile games have existed for less than 25 years. For this reason, the knowledge base for this thesis includes a description of the video gaming industry, its background, global market value. The knowledge base also covers the general games' classifications by platforms, such as pc games, console games and mobile games, the games genres, such as triple A, action and hypercasual, as well as the workflow and structures of game development teams.      The research methodology applied for this study was a participatory action research with a qualitative approach for data collection and analysis. Therefore, the first phase was to diagnose the state of the data collection at the company, followed by action planning for implementing the process to improve the data collection, followed by an evaluation of the results derived from the process implementation and the documentation of the learnings.      Additionally, the research included data cross-referencing and triangulation. Furthermore, the data gathered included gaming industry literature, academic journals, experts' blogs, the researcher's own experiences and observations and an open-ended discussion with key stakeholders from the company.     The outcome of this thesis was the implementation of a process to collect players' behaviour data for mobile game development. By providing clarification of the roles and inputs the implemented process has enabled a continuous workflow for the game development teams. Furthermore, the implementation of the process facilitates the stakeholders' evaluation of the game's performance and allows them to make informed decisions on whether or not to continue a game's iteration. In addition to the decision-making improvement, the team learnt that standardizing the collection of events and parameters still allows to identify points for improvement.},

This progress is influenced by factors such as the increasing integration of artificial intelligence into these tools and techniques to achieve more effective results. This thesis investigates primary tools and techniques used in different stages of modern game development. The research was conducted as a literature review, in which various tools, such as programming techniques, game engines, and animation tools, were analysed. Additionally, the study investigates the requirements for tool selection.     The research reveals that popular game engines such as Unity, Unreal Engine, and Godot are widely used in game development because they support collaboration between different aspects of game creation. The findings also reveal that the game development process is significantly impacted by the choice of development tools. These tools improve collaboration among programming, design, and audio engineering, leading to improved game performance and user experience.     This research provides creators with valuable insights on how to utilise available tools and techniques more effectively in game creation, ensuring that the games meet the demands of both players and the evolving gaming industry.

  abstract = {The blockchain technology, initially created for cryptocurrency, has been re-purposed for recording state transitions of smart contracts---decentralized applications that can be invoked through external transactions. Smart contracts gained popularity and accrued hundreds of billions of dollars in market capitalization in recent years. Unfortunately, like all other computer programs, smart contracts are prone to security vulnerabilities that have incurred multibillion-dollar damages over the past decade. As a result, many automated threat mitigation solutions have been proposed to counter the security issues of smart contracts. These threat mitigation solutions include various tools and methods that are challenging to compare. This survey develops a comprehensive classification taxonomy of smart contract threat mitigation solutions within five orthogonal dimensions: defense modality, core method, targeted contracts, input-output data mapping, and threat model. We classify 133 existing threat mitigation solutions using our taxonomy and confirm that the proposed five dimensions allow us to concisely and accurately describe any smart contract threat mitigation solution. In addition to learning what the threat mitigation solutions do, we also show how these solutions work by synthesizing their actual designs into a set of uniform workflows corresponding to the eight existing defense core methods. We further create an integrated coverage map for the known smart contract vulnerabilities by the existing threat mitigation solutions. Finally, we perform the evidence-based evolutionary analysis, in which we identify trends and future perspectives of threat mitigation in smart contracts and pinpoint major weaknesses of the existing methodologies. For the convenience of smart contract security developers, auditors, users, and researchers, we deploy and maintain a regularly updated comprehensive open-source online registry of threat mitigation solutions, called Security Threat Mitigation (STM) Registry at .},

In this research, we develop an on-ledgeranalytics prototype, which facilitates the examinations of NFT bridges and theorizes aboutthe dimensions of interoperability. Practical implications reveal that hiding a token'strack in an otherwise supposedly transparent system is possible.

NFTs were first introduced on Ethereum, a blockchain with smart contract functionality. Non-fungible token (NFTs) are digital assets that signify ownership of specific items or content, utilizing blockchain to guarantee their authenticity and rarity.Built on blockchain technology, NFTs provide secure and transparent verification of ownership and authenticity. Unlike cryptocurrencies, NFTs are unique and cannot be replicated or exchanged on a one-to-one basis.Instead, they function as "smart contracts" that contain specific information about the assets they represent.A notable feature of NFTs is their ability to store metadata, including details about the creator, the digital asset, and its origin. This information is crucial in confirming the authenticity and ownership of the NFT.The popularity of Non-fungible token (NFTs) has surged recently, with their unique digital properties allowing for easy identification and customized trading based on factors like rarity and age. NFTs have had a significant impact on the decentralized application marketplace, attracting global attention because of the impressive returns in this growing market.

Along with the discussion of hedonic system adoption, we consider the factors with perceived enjoyment, economic incentive, and social influence. In order to verify our research model, data were collected from 350 adults with P2E game experience or recognition, and a structural equation model was carried out. The analysis results find that perceived enjoyment and subjective norm have a significant positive effect on the intention to use P2E games, and economic incentive does not have a significant effect. In addition, peer influence and external influence have a significant positive effect on subjective norm.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}CryptoKitties was the first widely recognized blockchain game. Players could own, breed, and trade kitties, which are the only prop in the game. The game gained explosive growth upon its release but quickly collapsed in a short time. This study analyzes its entire player activity history for the first time in literature and tries to find the reasons for the rise and fall of this first blockchain game mania. First, we extracted the five million transaction records among 100 thousand addresses involved in CryptoKitties in the past three years. Based on the numbers of addresses involved in the game each day, we divide the game progress into four stages: the primer, the rise, the fall, and the serenity. We construct a temporal kitty ownership transfer network and analyze the varying network parameters in the four stages. We find that a large number of players poured in during the 10th and 18th days since the game release and quickly exited in the following month. Since then, a few big players have gradually dominated the game, concentrating the game resources. Through further analysis, we find that the main reason for the rapid increase in the game popularity was the increase of public attention by media outlets, while the reasons for the rapid decline in the game popularity include the oversupply of kitties, the decreasing of player income, a widening gap between the rich and poor players, and the limitations of blockchain systems. Based on these observations, we advise on the further blockchain game design: (1) to finely control the production of props and avoid an oversupply, (2) to balance the gaming cost and revenue and protect the enjoyment of players, (3) to narrow down the gap between rich and poor and create an equal gaming community, (4) to consider the limitations of blockchain systems in their game designs.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

However, most blockchain games are not comparable to traditional games in terms of lifespan and player engagement. In this paper, we try to see the big picture in a small way to explore and determine the impact of gameplay and financial factors on player behavior in blockchain games. Taking Aavegotchi as an example, we collect one year of operation data to build player profiles. We perform an in-depth analysis of player behavior from the macroscopic data and apply an unsupervised clustering method to distinguish the attraction of the gameplay and incentives. Our results reveal that the whole game is held up by a small number of players with high-frequent interaction or vast amounts of funds invested. Financial incentives are indispensable for blockchain games for they provide attraction and optional ways for players to engage with the game. However, financial services are tightly linked to the free market. The game will face an irreversible loss of players when the market experiences depression. For blockchain games, well-designed gameplay should be the fundamental basis for the long-lasting retention of players.},

P2E gaming guilds (Elliott, 2021) are emerging as essential intermediaries bridging Web2 and Web3 ecosystems. Drawing from social network theory's study of brokerage motivations, this paper examines the structure and communication practices of a P2E guild, Yield Guild Games (YGG) on Twitter. Through a computational analysis of YGG's presence on Twitter, the paper compares two mention networks corresponding to a period of optimism, and a period of crisis. We used network analysis to examine the structure of YGG communication on Twitter (Rathnayake, 2023), analysed tweets using BERTopic topic modeling (Grootendorst, 2022), and extracted links to determine what information is shared within the network (Hoyng, 2023). The results demonstrate YGG's role as a ``cultural broker'' (Foster \& Ocejo, 2015) promoting the adoption of blockchain technologies, such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and ideologies (Swartz, 2017), ascribing legitimacy and value to particular actors and products in the Web3 ecosystem. The topic lists highlight prominent communication practices related to community building, such as AMA (ask me anything) sessions and airdrops.},

  abstract = {In computer science, an ontology is a way of showing the properties of a subject area and how they are related by defining a set of concepts and categories that represent the subject. There have been many attempts to create a widely accepted ontology for the universe of games. Most of these attempts are defined based on an analytical perspective: few have found frequent use outside universities, as they are not easily translated to the development of games, which is a design perspective. There are some core aspects of the domain that turn this task into a difficult goal to achieve. In addition, game designers tend to refuse a methodology or a structured way of developing a game; the main concern is that it can impair creativity in a field that could not survive without it. A defined ontology would improve and mature the growing industry of digital games, both by enhancing the understanding of the domain and by supporting a structured methodology for designing games. This paper describes the properties of digital games and shows how they make it difficult to create an ontology for that field of study, especially when it comes to a design perspective. It clarifies the closest approach to a unified ontology that there is for the game domain: the mechanics, dynamics and aesthetics framework (MDA). We propose the redefinition of MDA's taxonomy, calling it Redefining the MDA (RMDA), providing better use for the approach from a designer's perspective, embracing the design properties of the domain, and overcoming issues found in the literature of the game domain. The main purpose of this paper is to clarify the MDA framework by redefining its main components, mechanics, dynamics and aesthetics, as a way to make the tool more understandable and useful for game designers. Understanding aesthetics and how developers can invoke them by correctly defining mechanics and creating dynamics is the main focus of the paper. Thus, some examples are provided in order to explain the applicability of the RMDA as a methodology to produce games.},

  abstract = {Blockchain smart contracts can support the decentralisation of business processes, but due to smart contracts' specifics, their development is a complicated process. Introducing model-driven development principles in smart contract development can facilitate requirement specification, design, and implementation activities. This paper presents a model-driven development method MDAsmartCD (Model-Driven Architecture-based Smart Contract Development) to alleviate smart contract development by supporting the complete MDA life cycle, covering the definition of Computation-Independent Model, Platform-Independent Model, and two instances of Platform-Specific Models. In MDAsmartCD, model transformations (model-to-model and model-to-text) are used to produce smart contract code in the Hyperledger Fabric platform Go and the Ethereum platform Solidity programming languages. The method application was demonstrated by implementing the smart contract for the hackathon solution and executing the generated Solidity and Go smart contracts in the workflow of issuing certificates for hackathon participants. During the execution of the workflow, both deployed smart contracts behaved identically and recorded analogous results in respective blockchain data storages. This demonstrated that the MDAsmartCD method enables the generation of compilable and executable smart contract code, ready for deployment on a blockchain platform.},

  abstract = {The Ethereum blockchain-based electronic voting (e-voting) systems can emerge as a viable strategy in this era of contemporary democracies to revolutionize political elections and augment the efficacy of the electoral process. There are myriad advantages that the Ethereum blockchain has to offer, from fairness to increased voting rates. Unlike traditional voting protocols, the Ethereum blockchain can assure substantial cost savings and eliminate the necessity for electoral intermediaries. The use of the Ethereum blockchain in political contexts also ensures that elections are held with integrity while preserving the voters' privacy. Due to its popularity, provision of smart contracts logic, and various promising advantages, this systematic review aims to examine the potential deployment of decentralized e-voting systems integrated with Ethereum blockchain technology for democratic political elections. A systematic literature review (SLR) and the PICO approach, which stands for population, intervention, control, and outcomes, were adopted in this study to systematically analyze the existing literature. Key technological approaches identified in the voting system include the hybrid blockchain and privacy-preserving score voting. Among the noteworthy findings are the following: while adoption and complexity remain challenges across numerous e-voting frameworks, scalability, end-to-end security, enhanced efficiency, and effectiveness are key benefits. An exploration into the prospective future innovations, such as the integration of artificial intelligence and big data analytics into the Ethereum blockchain, was also included to further improve the reliability of the e-voting systems. It is believed that the Ethereum blockchain has a promising transformative impact on electoral politics and democratic processes, presenting a ray of hope for future elections.},

Thematic analysis of data, recorded through field studies and semi-structured interviews, identify four key themes: level design as an interdisciplinary effort; who is the level designer; the role of narrative in level design; and challenges of managing creativity in the level design process. Results indicate that while the role called level designer is often assigned to specific disciplines, the process of level design is usually highly interdisciplinary. Furthermore, this interdisciplinary collaboration requires management to maintain both creativity and efficient pipelines, by distributing ownership and facilitating communication and planning. The level design process seems particularly vulnerable to suboptimal interdisciplinary communication and planning, due to significant reliance on narrative design, game design, art, sound design, and tool development. While this article addresses level design specifically, most observations are comparable to previous findings on game development in general.},

However, it is not often associated with technological innovation. Blockchain technology, an innovation that emerged in the late 2000s, has generated animated discussions that are led, in the most part, by private sector institutions. A dearth of literature highlights the innovative blockchain projects supported by UN entities. The purpose of this study is to provide an overview of blockchain innovations supported by UN entities and explore opportunities for future studies. Design/methodology/approach This paper used an exploratory case study approach with the purpose of providing a broad perspective of blockchain innovations undertaken by UN entities in the quest to meet sustainable and equitable development across the world. Findings This study found 25 blockchain projects by 13 UN entities in 19 countries. The geographical spread of the case studies revealed that two studies have global jurisdiction, five studies in Africa, three in Europe, four in Latin America and the Caribbean and 11 in Asia, Oceania and the Middle East. Of the 19 countries, three had two projects each. Two countries had three projects and the rest had one project each. Of the 13 UN entities, three dominated with UNICEF (part of six projects), UNDP (part of 10 projects) and WFP (part of four projects). Finally, the 25 projects were divided among three categories of blockchain use cases, as defined by UN guidance documents. Five case studies focused on immutable record keeping, five on transfer of value and 15 on smart contracts. Originality/value This study offers a unique overview of blockchain efforts within UN entities. It provides a platform for future studies to reveal implicit assumptions, contrasting explanations and casual connections.},

Traditional static analysis tools and existing vulnerability detection methods often fail to address these challenges comprehensively, leading to high false-positive rates and an inability to detect dynamic vulnerabilities. This paper introduces SmartLLM, a novel approach leveraging fine-tuned LLaMA 3.1 models with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of smart contract auditing. By integrating domain-specific knowledge from ERC standards and employing advanced techniques such as QLoRA for efficient fine-tuning, SmartLLM achieves superior performance compared to static analysis tools like Mythril and Slither, as well as zero-shot large language model (LLM) prompting methods such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Experimental results demonstrate a perfect recall of 100\% and an accuracy score of 70\%, highlighting the model's robustness in identifying vulnerabilities, including reentrancy and access control issues. This research advances smart contract security by offering a scalable and effective auditing solution, supporting the secure adoption of decentralized applications.},

Common belief is that the ability to scale up a blockchain lies mainly in improving the underlying technology rather than deploying new hardware. Though recent research works have applied sharding techniques in enhancing scalability of blockchains, they do not cater for addressing the joint issue of data security and scalability in blockchains. This paper proposes an approach that makes a trade-off between security and scalability when designing blockchain based systems. It designs an efficient replication model, which creates dynamic sharding wherein blocks are stored in a varying number of nodes. In order to maintain required level of security, the proposed approach shows that the replication of blockchain over peer-to-peer network is minimized as the blockchain's length evolves according to a replication factor.},

The miners collectively build a tree of blocks, and they are paid when they create a node (mine a block) which will end up in the path of the tree that is adopted by all. Since the miners can hide newly mined nodes, they play a game with incomplete information. Here we consider two simplified forms of this game in which the miners have complete information. In the simplest game the miners release every mined block immediately, but are strategic on which blocks to mine. In the second more complicated game, when a block is mined it is announced immediately, but it may not be released so that other miners cannot continue mining from it. A miner not only decides which blocks to mine, but also when to release blocks to other miners. In both games, we show that when the computational power of each miner is relatively small, their best response matches the expected behavior of the bitcoin designer. However, when the computational power of a miner is large, he deviates from the expected behavior, and other Nash equilibria arise.},

  abstract = {Blockchain technology has affected many sectors since its emergence. The digital gaming industry is also one of the industries affected by blockchain applications. Blockchain technologies in digital games have gained momentum, especially non-fungible token (NFT) technology. Research shows that the level of use of these technologies by countries is quite different. There is not enough research on the use of these technologies by Turkish players. This study aims to determine Turkish players' use of blockchain NFT technologies in digital games. In this study, a cross-sectional survey, one of the survey models, was used. For this, a survey was prepared and applied by the researchers. 183 people voluntarily participated in the study. Most Turkish players have heard of NFT technology, but the use of this technology in games is deficient. While most of the players stated that making a profit from digital games would increase their desire to play, the rate of using NFT in games to increase their desire to play was found to be lower. While the effect of playing digital games on the players' starting to use the blockchain wallet was 9.4\%, the effect on acquiring the first NFT asset was 6.6\%. In this research, the use of NFT technology in digital games by Turkish players does not seem to be very common. Although very few of the Turkish players plan to use these technologies, they expressed their concerns. Although it is foreseen that digital games will play an important role in the spread of these technologies, the unpredictability of the opportunities offered by NFT technologies, the inadequacy of legal regulations, etc. factors are important barriers in this regard.},

Motivated from the aforementioned discussions, we integrate permissioned blockchain and smart contract with deep learning (DL) techniques to design a novel secure and efficient data sharing framework named PBDL. Specifically, PBDL first has a blockchain scheme to register, verify (using zero-knowledge proof), and validate the communicating entities using the smart contract-based consensus mechanism. Second, the authenticated data are used to propose a novel DL scheme that combines stacked sparse variational autoencoder (SSVAE) with self-attention-based bidirectional long short term memory (SA-BiLSTM). In this scheme, SSVAE encodes or transforms the healthcare data into new format, and SA-BiLSTM identifies and improves the attack detection process. The security analysis and experimental results using IoT-Botnet and ToN-IoT datasets confirm the superiority of the PBDL framework over existing state-of-the-art techniques.},

  abstract = {The paradigm shift from conventional mobility with combustion engine vehicles to electric mobility requires alternative business forms. The formerly independent industries are melting and the common value structures for stakeholders of the automotive, energy and infrastructure branches increasingly dissolve. As a result, the established business models are no longer economically viable and a long-term competitiveness of the companies can only be achieved by business model innovation. However, the available approaches for business model innovation are often perceived as being too complex and difficult to implement in practice. Hence, this paper presents a new game-based methodology that supports the systematic development of innovative business models in the field electric mobility. It is referred to as Business Model Gaming, as it takes advantage of gaming effects and introduces an innovation process using adapted and harmonized methods specific for electric mobility. A game- based and risk free environment provides a straightforward access to these methods and creates a common knowledge base for all game participants. By means of the game the flow effect increases the motivation, performance and creativity of all participants in order to systematically support the critical innovation step of idea generation. Finally, the practical implementation of the methodology confirms its operational capabilities.},

These games offer players the unique opportunity to earn real-world rewards through virtual gameplay activities. By examining the factors that drive players' decision-making in PTE games, we deepen our understanding of the intersection between virtual economies and real-world financial needs. The insights from this study can provide game developers and policymakers with valuable information to design and implement effective strategies that support individuals seeking alternative income sources and new economic models in the face of unprecedented challenges. To determine the prioritization of motivating factors among PTE game players, we utilized the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) analysis as part of a three-stage process: a literature review (Stage 1), expert evaluation (Stage 2), and AHP analysis (Stage 3). The study derived 12 critical factors in PTE gameplay from literature review, divided into three primary elements, each with four sub-factors. These primary factors include Gaming Experience (comprising Fun factor, Game Quality, Game Genre, and Challenge), Financial Outcomes (consisting of Tokenomics, ROI, Game Company Reliability, and Coin Price), and PTE Game Awareness (including Management, Game Entry Timing, Game Platform, and Community). This study uncovers the three primary factors that encourage participation in PTE games, with Gaming Experience emerging as the most critical, followed by Financial Outcomes and PTE Game Awareness. This finding underlines the need for game developers to prioritize the gaming experience to ensure the development and sustainability of PTE games.},

The NFT market is a rapidly growing field, and the rarity of NFT is an essential factor that affects its price, as scarcity leads to higher demand. This study focuses on the BAYC NFT collection, which is a successful and representative collection of profile picture NFT, and analyzes how rarity affects NFT prices. This paper investigates the relationship between the rarity and price of the BAYC NFT collection using formal concept analysis (FCA) method. The results show that rarity is a major factor influencing the price of NFT and the effect is more apparent in the medium rarity range. When rarity is very high or very low, other factors become significant determinants, such as the uniqueness and appeal of NFT, and even the naturalness of NFT images. This research highlights the importance of considering rarity when assessing NFT and underscores the need for a comprehensive evaluation of NFT rarity. This study also provides valuable insights into the NFT market and can be useful for NFT investors, creators, and collectors. Furthermore, the usefulness of FCA as a tool for quantifying NFT rarity and evaluating NFT price was demonstrated.},

  abstract = {Contract production and transaction are very common and important since it can greatly reduce future uncertainty and is well-organized by buyers, sellers, and trusted third parties (TTPs). However, current commodity trading systems (such as spot, futures, and forward contract) are still traditional centralized structures, which means that there may always be concerned about the single point of failure and data corruption. Besides, even though there already exists fragmentary decentralized applications (DApps) for the marketplace, order management, resale, delivery, financing, and insurance, they are not integrated for operating contract production and transaction comprehensively. In this work, a blockchain-enabled integrated marketing platform (BeIMP) is proposed for contract production and transactions. BeIMP is a consortium blockchain (CsBc) framework that enables better safety, efficiency, and interoperability among stakeholders. BeIMP can directly match producers and consumers and reduce the problem of intermediaries' improper market operation. BeIMP has a three-tier risk diversification mechanism. First, both parties can know the quantity and price according to the contract specification (CSpec) in advance to avoid future uncertainty. Second, the buyers can resell the established order if they need, thereby diversifying the risk. Third, the concept of insurance is introduced to reduce force majeure and other systemic risks. BeIMP can also help producers get the loan from the financial institution (FI) if they need fund for production. We implement and demonstrate the prototype in contract farming (CF) first and discuss its generalizability to other scenarios. Experiment results show that the smart contract (SC) function is stable enough and the proof of authority (PoA) has the advantage in throughput and can give users a better experience.},

This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a comprehensive automated card game prototyping framework. The approach highlights a graph-based indexing method for generating novel game designs, an LLM-driven system for consistent game code generation validated by gameplay records, and a gameplay AI constructing method that uses an ensemble of LLM-generated action-value functions optimized through self-play. These contributions aim to accelerate card game prototyping, reduce human labor, and lower barriers to entry for game developers.},

The aim is to address the difficulties encountered in traditional carbon data processing. The proposed method involves partitioning a consortium chain into multiple subchains and constructing a unique ``child/parent'' chain architecture, enabling cross-chain data access and significantly increasing throughput. Furthermore, the scheme enhances the security and processing capacity of subchains by dynamically increasing the number of validator broadcasting nodes and implementing parallel node operations within subchains. This approach effectively solves the problems of low throughput in single-chain blockchain networks and the challenges of cross-chain data sharing, realizing more efficient and scalable blockchain applications.},

Against this context, the objective of this work is to define a plastic credit system to increase the amount of recyclable plastics.

The methodology proposed is based on a unified and transparent credit system established by a double-chain system, which comprises a public blockchain CreditChain and a consortium blockchain M-InfoChain.

This paper considers the Optimal Blockchain Sharding (OBCS) problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) where the decision variables are the number of shards, block size and block interval. Previous works solved the OBCS problem via Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based methods, where the action space must be discretized to increase processability. However, the discretization degrades the quality of the solution since the optimal solution usually lies between discrete values. In this paper, we treat the block size and block interval as continuous decision variables and provide dynamic sharding strategies based on them. The Branching Dueling Q-Network Blockchain Sharding (BDQBS) algorithm is designed for discrete action spaces. Compared with traditional DRL algorithms, the BDQBS overcomes the drawbacks of high action space dimensions and difficulty in training neural networks. And it improves the performance of the blockchain system by 1.25 times. We also propose a sharding control algorithm based on the Parameterized Deep Q-Networks (P-DQN) algorithm, i.e., the Parameterized Deep Q-Networks Blockchain Sharding (P-DQNBS) algorithm, to efficiently handle the discrete--continuous hybrid action space without the scalability issues. Also, the method can effectively improve the TPS by up to 28\%.},

Lack of trust of the mechanism is the main factor in restricting the development of port supply chains.

As the bridge between blockchains and port supply chains, smart contracts reconstruct the business process of blockchain-empowered port supply chains. In this article, we present an architecture of a consortium blockchain-empowered port supply chain system, and propose a system verification framework for the smart contracts of port supply chains with probabilistic behaviors.

The requirements are specified by PCTL (Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic).

We use it to demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework, and identify the smart contracts that do not meet the expected needs of users.},

This study focuses on addressing these scalability issues in 5G blockchain networks by analyzing key factors such as transaction throughput, consensus mechanisms, and network latency. We propose several models to improve scalability, including sharding, sidechains, optimized consensus algorithms, and off-chain solutions. These models were evaluated through simulations using real-time data, with accuracy levels of up to 95\% in predicting performance improvements across various metrics. The paper investigates the challenges specific to 5G environments, such as high transaction volumes and diverse device requirements, and assesses the strengths and limitations of each scalability technique in this context.

It underscores the advantages of e-scooters in smart cities while also addressing the issues stemming from incorrect riding practices. To understand the strategies of both cities and e-scooter companies, the study adopts a game theory approach. The research delves into how blockchain technology and hardware oracles can promote the appropriate use of e-scooters. In one scenario, the city allocates resources to infrastructure to facilitate e-scooter travel, while the e-scooter company defines its service. Nonetheless, continuous misuse of e-scooters negatively impacts both parties. Therefore, in another scenario, the research assesses how blockchain can detect and penalize incorrect behaviors using smart contracts. The findings reveal that while blockchain bolsters smart mobility and curbs the incorrect use of e-scooters, it might also dissuade certain users from utilizing the service, presenting a set of challenges to smart mobility.},

Industries such as energy, transportation, and healthcare are already integrating DLTs into their operations. On the other hand, recent advances and the increasing popularity of the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies are also enabling new and exciting ways of interaction and sensing for mobile device users. Mobile gaming is another prominent industry that can be benefited from these technological developments and has the potential to create business opportunities. In this paper, we explore the uses of Distributed Ledger Technology in Mobile Gaming and for this purpose, we have taken a location-based IoT mobile gaming use case and propose new gaming features for the players by the addition of the DLT. We propose a platform for creating and playing scavenger hunt games using low-power BLE beacons. It allows smartphones to interact with the predetermined real-world locations and players can observe the surrounding environment looking for ``clues'' in the game. At the end of a hunt, the player receives rewards that are stored on a distributed ledger as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) and can bring in-game advantages for the next hunts. The proposed system is implemented using off-the-shelf devices and IoT beacons. We implemented our hybrid architecture by using AWS Lambda, Hyperledger Fabric managed blockchain and DynamoDB. We performed multiple experiments measuring the time taken for the end-to-end process, IoT beacon response times and the throughput of the Fabric network. Using the performance results, we estimated the maximum number of active players that can be supported by the game. Finally, we discuss business opportunities and limitations of the proposed proof of concept.},

The Circular Game is a strategy board game to learn about sustainability, improve environmental awareness, apply circular economy strategies, and train to design innovative and circular business models. Researchers will analyse changes in participants' sustainable knowledge, awareness, and behaviour before and after participation in the game with ad hoc questionnaires. The results of this analysis will allow us to test whether the emotions generated during the play-based learning process can condition their environmental awareness, learning and behaviour towards greater sustainability in the future. The game can generate emotions in participants and work teams, promote collaborative and green knowledge acquisition, and help bachelor and master students and employees apply theoretical knowledge to real-world situations. Similarly, companies and entrepreneurs need a relaxed environment to present their ideas and proposals for improvement. This methodology uses game elements in academic or working environments to stimulate and challenge participants to incorporate sustainable business choices. The Circular Game is a game in which participants compete to be the company that applies the most circular economy strategies in its business model. The groups advance through a circular board where, depending on the squares they land on, they can earn money, invest in circular economy strategies, and add or reduce CO2 emissions. The winner will be the one who has completed all the circular economy strategies set out in the game with the minimum of CO2 emissions. The social impact is substantial as it is a methodology that can be applied in any field, educational or business. The impact will be more significant if the game's objective, to be more sustainable, is translated into the participants' real lives.},

Even though tokens provide benefits such as easier market access, increased liquidity, lower transaction costs, and automated transactional process, their valuation and price determination are still challenging due to factors such as a lack of intrinsic value, volatility, and regulation making trading risky. In this paper, we address this knowledge gap by reviewing the existing literature on token creation and valuation to identify and document the factors affecting their valuation, investment, and founding, as well as the most promising domains of applicability. The study follows the PRISMA methodology and uses the Web of Science database, defining clear research questions and objective inclusion criteria for the articles. We discuss token technical development, including creating, issuing, and managing tokens on an Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts. The study revealed several key factors that significantly impact the field of tokenomics: demand and supply, social incentives, market conditions, macroeconomics, collective behavior, speculation, and inclusion in index funds. The most relevant use cases of blockchain and tokens are related to the digitization of virtual and physical assets, accountability, and traceability usual in smart grids or supply chains management, social governance, and art and gamification including metaverse.},

(1) These solutions store user information in centralized databases, thereby exposing them to potential risks such as single points of failure and privacy breaches. (2) The lack of data compatibility between various applications leads to escalated communication expenses. (3) While existing solutions strive to tackle these challenges through blockchain, tracking malicious users often proves to be challenging. Moreover, due to the full-replication strategies of the blockchain, the storage overhead becomes excessive. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a scalable identity management scheme utilizing blockchain technology, with the primary goal of enhancing identity protection and traceability. We also integrate blockchain technology with Reed-Solomon (RS) encoding and Certificateless Aggregate Signature (CLAS) to safeguard user information, with each node specifically storing a portion of the encoded data block. In contrast to traditional identity management solutions. (1) Our approach tackles the single point of failure problem by blockchain. Simultaneously, it ensures the security of identity and the ability to track malicious users. Users need only upload information once to access different applications without maintaining multiple sets of account passwords. (2) Furthermore, compared to the traditional blockchain full replication strategy, our method significantly reduces storage overhead from O(n) to O(1), greatly improving scalability. Meanwhile, we eliminate time for block searches, accelerating the processes of authentication and information traceability. (3) Our scheme employs CLAS to verify data integrity, ensuring the reliability of received data. In the real world, our solution demonstrates high availability and scalability, with performance analysis and experimental evaluation providing relevant data for validation.},

However, concerns have emerged about possible wash trading, a form of market manipulation in which one party repeatedly trades an NFT to inflate its volume artificially. Our research examines the effects of wash trading on the NFT market in Ethereum from the beginning until January 2022, using multiple approaches. We find that wash trading affects 5.66\% of all NFT collections, with a total artificial volume of \$3,406,110,774. We look at two ways to profit from wash trading: Artificially increasing the price of the NFT and taking advantage of the token reward systems provided by some marketplaces. Our findings show that exploiting the token reward systems of NFTMs is much more profitable (mean gain of successful operations is \$1.055M on LooksRare), more likely to succeed (more than 80\% of operations), and less risky than reselling an NFT at a higher price using wash trading (50\% of activities result in a loss). Our research highlights that wash trading is frequent in Ethereum and that NFTMs should implement protective mechanisms to stop such illicit behavior.},

  abstract = {Scalability is a challenging issue in blockchain technology, becoming more critical as blockchain systems grow in the amount of transaction data or number of users. Some key metrics affecting scalability in blockchain technology include transaction throughput and latency as well as the storage and communication capabilities the nodes need to participate in the network. Most proposed solutions for blockchain scalability handle only one or a few of these scalability issues assuming that all the blockchain nodes are homogeneous in computational, communication, and storage capabilities. This assumption results in degrading system efficiency and worsens scalability issues due to the unfair distribution of workload among the blockchain nodes. This paper presents a new solution for blockchain scalability that enhances scalability using multi-level sharding based on the heterogeneity of network nodes. In fact, the heterogeneous nodes are dynamically scored based on their resource capacities and contributions to the protocol and then are organized into multiple levels based on their calculated scores and form a hierarchical tree structure. Additionally, a new mechanism for consensus is introduced which makes use of the hierarchical structure to enable a more secure and decentralized consensus-making process. The simulation experiments showed that the proposed solution significantly improves various scalability measurements, including throughput, latency, storage efficiency, and communication overhead while increasing decentralization and maintaining security. The improvement rate over the scalability metrics achieved by the proposed work is proportional to the characteristics of the hierarchical tree structure such as depth and branching ratio.},

However, little is known about the overall structure and evolution of the NFT market. Here, we analyse data concerning 6.1 million trades of 4.7 million NFTs generating a total trading volume of 935 millions US dollars. Our data are obtained primarily from the Ethereum and WAX blockchains and cover the period between June 23, 2017 and April 27, 2021. First, we characterize the statistical properties of the market. Second, we build the network of interactions and show that traders have bursts of activity followed by inactive periods, and typically specialize on NFTs associated to similar objects. Third, we cluster objects associated to NFTs according to their visual features and show that NFTs within the same category tend to be visually homogeneous. Finally, we investigate the predictability of NFT sales. We use simple machine learning algorithms and find that prices can be best predicted by the sale history of the NFT collection, but also by some features describing the properties of the associated object (e.g., visual features of digital images). We anticipate that our analysis will be of interest to both researchers and practitioners and will spark further research on the NFT production, adoption and trading in different contexts.},

We will discuss transparency, robustness, and payload of watermarking techniques aiming to educate the artists, researchers, and developers about the many approaches that watermarking techniques provide and the resulting trade-offs. We focus on fragile watermarking techniques due to their high transparency for embedding into artistic works. We discuss the spread spectrum and Least Significant Bit techniques. We describe the usual process of NFT minting into a blockchain and propose a more secure certification protocol with watermarking which employs the same usual NFT minting offered by current marketplaces. The proposed certification protocol mints a checksum string into a blockchain, ensuring the validity of the watermark and the information embedded into this watermark. This proposed protocol validates the date of creation and author identification which are transparently embedded in the artistic work, thus, increasing the security and confidence of markets for artistic works transactions.},

  abstract = {The e-mail allegedly attributed to Satoshi Nakamoto (supposedly a pseudonym) was transmitted 14 years ago, describing the development of an electronic currency (Nakamoto, 2008). The design of this electronic currency represented the solution of the general Byzantine problem, a well-known problem in computing, which, in general terms, defines that one of the parts of a system can intentionally fail, and with that, make the entire network unavailable. Therefore, the premise is that part of the system is corrupt (Dolev et al., 1982). In the few lines of the email, Satoshi Nakamoto described such a solution and published an article with the details made available on the same date. The article describes how to transmit information within a chain of blocks that are: synchronized with date and time (time stamp); combined with code that depends on a previous block (hash code); can be validated with public and private key cryptography framework anonymously and decentrally; but highly resilient to any tampering attempt and with public record. The concept of digital currency, in this case Bitcoin, consisted at that time of a code or token resulting from encryption and that could be included in these blocks. Blocks registered definitively in the ledgers distributed along the blockchain network that could be traced. The digital framework developed by Satoshi Nakamoto, although it emerged to make Bitcoin viable as a digital currency, has been separated over the last 14 years. Blockchain can be understood as a decentralized communication technology that gave rise to a family of other technological structures of encrypted communication such as ecosystems, public blockchain, private blockchain and blockchain networks, mainly (Mazumdar Ruj, 2022). Digital currencies, on the other hand, have also developed in variety and quantity, so much so that as we write this editorial there are over 10,000 digital currencies in operation. The total capitalization value of digital currencies rose from USD 18 billion at the beginning of 2017, surpassing USD 1.4 trillion by mid-2021 (Su et al., 2022). Currently, there is no technological impediment for companies to create their own digital currencies using a Bitcoin network or an Etherium network, for example, as well as many other networks available.Obviously, even today, there are technical challenges related, mainly, to the scalability of these networks and currencies. Bitcoin, when created, had a capacity of 7 transactions per second, currently, as we write this editorial, the transaction capacity of the Bitcoin network (BTS) is 14 transactions per second. The Etherium (ETH) network was born with a capacity of 20 transactions per second and currently has a capacity of 35 transactions per second. For comparison purposes, the VISA network has a capacity of 1700 transactions per second, which shows that there is still some way to make blockchain networks the new communication backbone, scalable for more mass uses (Chauhan Patel, 2022). There are implementations of the Solana network, for example, which promises to reach 50,000 transactions per second, still in the confirmation phase from a practical point of view, which could allow running Internet of Things (IoT) applications on this blockchain network (Duffy et al., 2021).At the same time, since 2013, the reorganization of the TCP IP structure from IPv4 (4.2 billion IP addresses) to IPv6 (79 octillion IP addresses or 7.9 x ) more than the total number of IPv4 addresses) has been implemented. Such implementation made it possible to expand connectivity to a level sufficient for the world demand, which is 56 octillion (56 x ) addresses per human being on earth. In terms of addressing, the possibilities of connecting new and future elements on the internet/blockchain communication network are guaranteed, making the IoT (Internet of Things) a real possibility.In addition to the traditional applications dedicated to making digital currency viable, especially in the last 5 years, certain works resulting from the combination of information technology and human creativity (also known as creative economy) brought NFT (Non-Fungible Token) to the management field. NFT are tokens (produced through encrypted code, subscribed in some blockchain network) that express the ownership of their author. Whoever acquires an NFT, has his/her record recorded in a ledger and, therefore, can exercise the rights or benefits related to the possession of that NFT. There are two main origins of an NFT, digital games and works of art or graphic expressions (Vasan et al., 2022). In the case of digital games, NFT can be used to record permanently and nominally the ``achievements achieved'' within a given game. Its owner now takes possession of a certain item that, previously, would only exist within the game itself, a virtual (digital) environment. In the case of graphic, artistic expressions, and other works of art, it is possible to make your possession digital. Works from the natural environment (physical), the result of expressions of human creativity, are now registered in an NFT-type token, coming to exist in the virtual world (digital). In this way, the works, and the data of their authorship and ownership, are permanently registered in the ledger of a blockchain network specialized in transacting NFT. As in the game, the possession of an NFT of a work of art allows the author to trade or use the benefits related to the possession of this NFT.From the convergence of connectivity technologies such as cloud computing, the advent of IPV6 and technologies based on tokens (blockchain, crypto assets and NFT not exhaustively) the concept of Web 3.0 becomes viable. Web 3.0 can be understood as a network of people and physical objects, making the integration between the natural world and the virtual world more intense (augmented, virtual and mixed reality). The idea of a Metaverse (Web 3.0 Application) depends on the technological availability that we describe here very succinctly and on the realization of new social behaviors that are underway (Korkmaz et al., 2022).The context described is not new to most practitioners and academics involved with innovation. However, by describing it in general terms, we can identify different research objects that may be of interest to the community working in the field of innovation management. Evidently, within the research perspectives, especially in innovation management, parallel logics can be established with the more established theories or concepts, which allow an approximation with the new technological objects available to people and companies. Such technologies have permeated traditional companies and startups that have a specific focus on these connectivity technologies described as core business or as business support.The idea of this editorial comment is to recognize the possibility of receiving more technological articles or scientific articles, perspectives and book reviews that consider connectivity and tokenization technologies as research objects. Such technologies can be positioned in research both as objects of analysis and as contextual and organizational objects. Whether contextual and organizational can bring research involving routines, capabilities, competencies and business models, whose core business process is innovation at different scales, natures, degrees of novelty, stages of diffusion or adoption. To cite just one possibility, as an example, the model by Tidd and Bessant from 2009, which describes the construct of orientation to innovation strategy, used in several research in the field of innovation since then, can be revised in the new contexts or in the face of new technologies (Ferreira et al., 2015). If such technologies are positioned as objects of analysis, research can involve every part of the innovation management process such as searching for innovations, selecting innovations, implementing innovations, generating value with innovations, and capturing value with innovations in analysis of single level or multilevel. In addition to the direct positioning of token and blockchain-based technologies, as an object or as a contextual aspect, adjacent effects are expected, for instance, involving intellectual property, environmental and social sustainability, technological governance, people management and other consequences that may be the focus of research, considering the emerging technologies mentioned above. There is also the field of research that is dedicated to the development of new products, both defining new models of digital product development and methods derived from these models, without forgetting all the implications related to the issues of information security management involved in these contexts of token transactions (Baudier et al., 2022). Although the possibilities for theoretical and managerial development for the area of innovation research, involving technologies based on tokens and blockchain, are broad, there is research that can be very relevant, but that would be better received in journals in mathematics, computer science or even software engineering and not in journals dedicated to innovation. Research that develops a new way of doing encryption, or even a more efficient algorithm that allows increasing the capacity of transactions per second, the design of a new network or a new ecosystem based on blockchain or even research that develops improvements in consensus protocols of blockchain undoubtedly has great value but would be expected in engineering or math journals. On the other hand, there are studies that bring reports of implementations of a business application on a blockchain basis, either as a business support application, or in the form of designing a blockchain-based product that will be taken to the market (Wan et al., 2022). In these cases, applied research, from the point of view of innovation research, what is expected to be found in the article is the development of knowledge that demonstrates how, why or to what extent the innovation processes were sensitized, or in what way the process of innovation contributed or presented limitations to support the reported implementation. In this way, such research can be received as technological articles, since the theoretical elements that relate the innovation process, or the management of the innovation process with the implementation based on token or blockchain, will be present, which are the bases of analysis used to support the expansion of innovation theories, innovation management or management practices in innovation contexts.Finally, we invite the entire community to submit papers with theoretical discussions related to paradigm shifts, involving the dematerialized nature of new products and their tendency towards a service-oriented view (Jain et al., 2022).As it should be clear, this editorial comment did not explore all the possibilities of research in innovation management involving technologies based on tokens and blockchain, but only a few examples that can help to obtain insights. We intend, in some way, to encourage the innovation community to develop studies considering new technologies, developing, or expanding theories and knowledge of innovation.},

  abstract = {The continually developing game studies field has given rise to the question of `How do games tell stories?' In response, this thesis aims to develop the ongoing understanding of narrative game mechanics (NGMs) and their capabilities as affect producing mechanics. By utilising a braided approach involving the roles of researcher, player, spectator and designer this thesis  achieves a multi-faceted view of the emerging understandings of NGMs. This study builds on work from key researchers including Teun Dubbelman, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. In addition, work from the fields of affect and horror is drawn upon  to create a strong theoretical underpinning which then contributed to four textual analyses. This involved two interactive fictions, The Uncle Who Works for Nintendo (2014a) and Stories Untold (2017); and two video games, INSIDE (2016) and Until Dawn (2015). As NGMs are still in their nascence, this necessitated the creation of a new analytical framework to aid in identifying and analysing any NGMs present in the games chosen. By drawing on the work of the theorists noted above, among others, the Action, Aesthetics, Mechanics and Narration (AAMN) framework was created. This framework establishes the basic actions afforded to the player and proceeds through progressive levels to determine whether they have contributed to the game's narrative. As the Narration level can be indistinct, YouTube Let's Plays of the chosen games were utilised to contribute to this gap as they offer player driven commentary and can function as a paratext of the chosen games. In addition to the textual analyses carried out, an IF was designed (using the platform Twine) which was also analysed using the previously noted framework. Player feedback was collected in place of the YouTube Let's Plays used for the other games analysed. Taking on the role of a designer allowed insights on creating NGMs. Consideration of what could be accomplished within the possibilities and limitations of Twine further enforced the creative practice of thinking within a medium. This approach allowed for the creation of an exploratory artefact which aided in generating new knowledge through reflection on the creative practice used. The insights gained from the designer role aided in the textual analyses and vice versa. By utilising a braided role approach this enabled a more rounded reflection and analysis of NGMs and their affective capabilities. This thesis concludes by establishing that two specific NGMs have been identified during the research. These NGMs, the information mechanic and purposeful ambiguity,  function as affective mechanics with horror-affect producing capabilities. Furthermore, this thesis contributes an extended definition of NGMs to the academic field, and notes that NGMs go beyond encouraging the game narrative, and further proposes definitions for the two specific NGMs identified.},

  abstract = {With the evolution of technology, blockchain a swiftly impending phenomenon i.e., "decentralized computing'' is observed. The emergence of Smart Contracts (SC) has resulted in advancements in the application of blockchain technology. The Ethereum network's computing capabilities and functionalities are founded on the basis of SC. A smart contract is a self-executing agreement between buyer and seller with the terms of the settlement between them, written directly as lines of code, existing across a distributed decentralized blockchain network. It is a decentralized software that runs on a blockchain autonomously, consistently, and publicly. Conversely, due to the complex semantics of fundamental domain-specific languages and their testability, constructing reliable and secure SC can be extremely difficult. SC might contain some vulnerabilities. Security vulnerabilities can originate from financial tribulations; there are a number of notorious events that specify blockchain SC could comprise numerous code-security vulnerabilities. Security and privacy of blockchain-based SC are very important, we must first identify their vulnerabilities before implementing them widely. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to conduct a comprehensive experimental evaluation of two current security testing tools: Remix solidity static analysis plugin and Solium which are used for static analysis of SC. We have conducted an empirical analysis of SC for finding tangible and factual evidence, controlled by the scientific approach. The methodology's first step is to gather all of the Ethereum SC and store them in a repository. The next step is to use the Remix solidity static analysis plugin and Solium to perform vulnerability assessments. The last step is to analyze the result of both tools and evaluate them on the basis of accuracy and effectiveness. The goal of this empirical analysis is to evaluate the two FOSS tools: Remix solidity static analysis plugin and Solium on the basis of accuracy and effectiveness. Some research questions were considered to reach the stated goal: What automated tools and frameworks are proposed in supporting the state-of-the-art empirical approach to SC vulnerability detection? How accurate are security analysis tools? And which tool has more accuracy rate? How effectively security analysis tools are detecting vulnerabilities in SC? And which is the most effective security analysis tool? We investigated the effectiveness and accuracy of security code analysis tools on Ethereum by testing them on a random sample of vulnerable contracts. The results indicate that the tools have significant discrepancies when it comes to certain security characteristics. In terms of effectiveness and accuracy, the Remix plugin outperformed and beat the other tool.},

The computer science course has a didactic potential in terms of the formation of initiative, independence, imagination, the ability to set and solve problems. The presented study aimed at substantiating the effectiveness of game mechanics use in teaching computer science to solve the problem associated with the need to develop the creative thinking of students. Methodology . The mechanics ``Achievement,'' ``Reckoning on trust,'' ``Fun once - always fun,'' ``User progress'' are implemented with game elements and methods in the study of theoretical computer science. Resources of digital services (interactive whiteboards, random selection generators) are used for gamification. The base of the experiment is a secondary school with in-depth study of individual subjects in the Stulovo village (Slobodskoy district, Kirov region). The study covered 74 students of the seventh grade (64\% - girls and 36\% - boys). The average age of the respondents is 13 years. Statistical processing of the results was performed using Pearson's chi-squared test. Results. During the game, students study theoretical material, solve a system of creative and non-standard tasks on the topic ``Measurement of information.'' For each game mechanic, a goal, tasks, sets of rules and restrictions are defined. Statistically significant differences in the qualitative changes that have taken place in the system according to the levels of development of creative thinking are identified. Conclusion . The features of the presented version of the application of game mechanics in teaching computer science in terms of the development of creative thinking are described: taking into account the age characteristics of students when formulating message texts, inclusion of digital services, combination of oral and written speech with interaction on a computer network.},

  abstract = {The design of video games has a tremendous impact in shaping our experience, and one area is through their visual designs. Action games in particular engulf the player in highly dynamic and sensory rich environments where challenges can easily be misperceived. For example, the player may feel overwhelmed, fail to notice important elements, or take the wrong course of action as a result of distractions. Pinpointing and solving these problems are difficult without taking into consideration the underlying mechanisms of human visual information processing. In this effort, this dissertation develops a perception-based game design framework supported by a theory of visual attention. This framework was applied to consider perceptual features of motion affecting the visual design, and their effects on the player's experience. Perceptual features of motion are often overlooked in games, but cannot be ignored. Perception and attention researchers found numerous effects of motion on users' task performances and affective responses that are of interest to the game design and user research community. The contribution of this work consists of an investigation of a perception-based framework for elements in motion within commercial and an experimental game called EMOS (Expressive MOtion Shooter). This is followed by identifying and validating two perception-based guidelines. The guidelines are novel such they are empirically expressed, based on expert game designers' manipulations of perceptual features in EMOS. This contribution also benefits the design and human computer interaction communities, since results include qualitative reflections from game designers concerning this topic.},

  abstract = {Two-thirds of Americans play computer games. Although among the most complex and energyintensive plug loads, gaming has been largely overlooked in energy research and development and policy. Systems used for computer gaming in California consumed 4.1 terawatt-hours/year in 2016 or \$700 million in energy bills, with emissions of 1.5 million tons carbon dioxideequivalent allocated 66 percent to consoles, 31 percent to desktop personal computers, 3 percent to laptops, and less than 1 percent to emerging media streaming devices. Key findings include: {$\bullet$} Aggregate energy demand places gaming among the top plug loads in California, with gaming representing one-fifth of the state's total miscellaneous residential energy use. {$\bullet$} Market structure changes could substantially affect statewide energy use; energy demand could rise by 114 percent by 2021 under intensified desktop gaming, or fall by 24 percent given a major shift towards consoles coupled with energy efficiency gains. {$\bullet$} Unit energy consumption is remarkably varied across gaming platform types: across 26 systems tested, client-side electricity use ranged from 5 to more than 1,200 kWh per year, reflecting equipment choice and usage patterns. {$\bullet$} Some emerging technologies and activities are driving energy demand higher, including processor overclocking, cloud-based gaming, higher-resolution connected displays, and virtual reality gaming. {$\bullet$} User behavior influences gaming energy use more than technology choice; duty cycle and game choice are particularly strong drivers of demand. {$\bullet$} Energy efficiency opportunities are substantial, about 50 percent on a per-system basis for personal computers and 40 percent for consoles if past rates of improvement continue. While simultaneously quantifying efficiency and gaming performance is problematic, evidence suggests that efficiency can be improved while maintaining or improving user experience. Familiar energy policy strategies can help manage gaming energy demand, although mandatory system-level standards are not promising (component-level measures may be).},

Although initial empirical studies on serious games usage deliver discussable results, numerous questions remain unacknowledged. In particular, questions regarding the quality of their formal conceptual design in relation to their purpose mostly stay uncharted. In the majority of cases the designers' good intentions justify incoherence and insufficiencies in their design. In addition, serious games are mainly assessed in terms of the quality of their content, not in terms of their intention-based design. This paper argues that analyzing a game's formal conceptual design, its elements, and their relation to each other based on the game's purpose is a constructive first step in assessing serious games. By outlining the background of the Serious Game Design Assessment Framework and exemplifying its use, a constructive structure to examine purpose-based games is introduced. To demonstrate how to assess the formal conceptual design of serious games we applied the SGDA Framework to the online games "Sweatshop" (2011) and "ICED" (2008).},

  abstract = {Game mechanics, the rules that simulate the virtual world inside a game, take a great part in what makes a game unique. For digital games, this uniqueness reduces the opportunity for software reuse. A high-level software architecture for game mechanics, however, can still be reused where a single, specific implementation cannot. Despite that potential, existing research on game development lacks a comprehensive analysis of how game mechanics could benefit from the field of software architecture. This limits the opportunities for developers and researchers alike to benefit from findings on the subject. To help guide future research on game development, we analyzed the state-of-the-art architectures in game mechanics through a systematic literature review. This work carefully documents data from 36 studies, analyzing the reflections and compromises between design requirements, practices, and restrictions, as well as how they contribute to different types of mechanics. The main findings are that researchers favor reduced development complexity, but often tailor their solutions to specific games or genres. We conclude that a valuable avenue for future research in the field is the generalization of architectural solutions around specific types of mechanics and formalizing the use of software engineering for game mechanics.},

Recently smart contracts are becoming prominent parts of various blockchain platforms. The goal of smart contracts is to eliminate the third party and centralized trust systems. Due to recent emergence of smart contracts, there is no well-defined framework that researchers can use to evaluate smart contracts under various blockchain platforms and differentiate between them. In this work, a survey on the prominent smart contract landscape specially those based on blockchain have been conducted. Based on the survey, an evaluation framework to assess smart contracts has been proposed. The framework is a set of criteria based on two major aspects; infrastructure related and development related criteria. The evaluation framework was peer-reviewed for reliability and validity. To measure the applicability of the proposed framework, it has been used to empirically evaluate some of the most prominent smart contract platforms. The results of the empirical evaluation have shown that the Ethereum blockchain smart contract exceeds the others in terms of development tools, resources, and community support. EOS blockchain smart contracts have the best execution speeds, and transaction costs. Lastly, Stellar blockchain has predictability and the best transaction builder to use in smart contract development concerning user friendliness. Recommendations for smart contract developers are provided in light of the research.},

Digital games can improve older people's leisure, social connections, and cognitive functions. However, most digital games currently available on the market are aimed at a younger audience and have features that are not always attractive to older people. We applied the means-end theory to discover the attributes of games that appeal to older people and the consequences and values reached from each attribute. Using the laddering technique, we interviewed 22 participants aged 60 years or older to obtain a Hierarchical Value Map. The interviews were conducted in Brazil from April to July 2019. As reported by the interviewees, the resultant hierarchies provide information about the relations between game attributes and their consequences and values. Values are the basis of value-based design, and understanding how to achieve them will enable a more suitable design for the target audience, such as the desire to keep in touch with friends and the need to manage their privacy and autonomy. We found 16 attributes and 12 values and discussed four means-end chains. We expect that the results from this study will serve as a reference for game developers with a focus on the older audience.},

As a result, more and more blockchains have begun to adopt proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocols to address those challenges. One of the fundamental characteristics of any blockchain technology is its crypto-economics and incentives. Lately, each PoS blockchain has designed a unique reward mechanism, yet, many of them are prone to free-rider and nothing-at-stake problems. To better understand the ad-hoc design of reward mechanisms, in this paper, we develop a reward mechanism framework that could apply to many PoS blockchains. We formulate the block validation game wherein the rewards are distributed for validating the blocks correctly. Using evolutionary game theory, we analyze how the participants' behaviour could potentially evolve with the reward mechanism. Also, penalties are found to play a central role in maintaining the integrity of blockchains.},

NFTs are digital assets that operate on blockchain technology and are traded using cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Tezos, Solana, among others. However, there is limited knowledge regarding the economics of NFTs and people's perspectives and experiences with them. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to present diverse understandings of NFT gaming and digital marketing, analyze the benefits and drawbacks of NFTs, and explore their potential in the metaverse. This study utilizes a qualitative investigation approach involving nine respondents from the NFT, blockchain, and gaming communities. The research employs case study and descriptive analysis methods. The conclusion drawn from this study recommends the utilization of NFTs and expects readers to find this research beneficial. NFTs represent digital assets that are uniquely identifiable and traded using blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. Despite their popularity and increasing trading prices, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding the economics of NFTs, as well as people's perspectives and experiences with them. This research aims to address this gap by providing diverse insights into NFT gaming and digital marketing, exploring the benefits and drawbacks of NFTs, and investigating their potential in the metaverse. The study employs a qualitative investigation methodology and involves nine participants from the NFT, blockchain, and gaming communities. The research utilizes case study and descriptive analysis methods to gather and analyze data. The study examines the impressions and experiences of individuals engaged in crypto games. The results indicate that most players dedicate 2 to 6 hours per day to playing crypto games. Moreover, it is found that the time required recovering one's investment in these games ranges from 1 to 90 days. The findings also reveal that players are concerned about the presence of potential economic instability in a volatile market. Additionally, issues such as value manipulation, privacy, security, and trust related to the design and utilization of NFTs are highlighted. Understanding the cryptocurrency market entails understanding the motivations of individuals who engage in paid games, as their interests are crucial for any government initiatives aimed at generating revenue. The study recommends that players explore the NFT Pakistan game.},

The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

Using mixed-methods research, we developed and validated the conceptual CI governance (CIG) framework, which satisfies CI principles through smart contracts and AI-assisted interfaces. The empirical evaluation demonstrates both social and technical improvements: 40\% increased civic participation rates, 85\% governance efficiency maintenance, and significant gains in engagement quality metrics (knowledge sharing +32\%, collective decision making +28\%). While technical implementation shows promise, success requires the careful integration of social dynamics, digital literacy initiatives, and regulatory compliance.

The main social media platforms used in this research will mainly be Twitter, Youtube and Tiktok, with the support of Facebook and Telegram for data collection.    The research focused on the cryptocurrency community in Vietnam. To reach the most insightful results, observation, a qualitative method, was used for research and data collection in this thesis. The observation was conducted for one month, from October 6th, 2021, to November 6th, 2021, in which certain users were selected from the community and their demographics were collected. However, in reality, the general observation, from the content to the reaction of the community and the competitors, was conducted for a total of 7 months, starting from May 2021. Close interaction with the community members, as well as the marketing department also played a crucial role during the observation process.    The study showed that the commissioning company has great and insightful content, yet the methods of distribution was not effective. They have not been executing the right strategy and method for each certain platform, therefore, the performance of their contents on these platforms were insignificant. The thesis has successfully collected useful data and pointed out where the commissioning party needs improvement in comparison with 3 selected competitors in the market, and proposals have been made accordingly.},

  abstract = {Interoperability is a central problem in digitization and sos engineering, which concerns the capacity of systems to exchange information and cooperate. The task to dynamically establish interoperability between heterogeneous cps at run-time is a challenging problem. Different aspects of the interoperability problem have been studied in fields such as sos, neural translation, and agent-based systems, but there are no unifying solutions beyond domain-specific standardization efforts. The problem is complicated by the uncertain and variable relations between physical processes and human-centric symbols, which result from, e.g., latent physical degrees of freedom, maintenance, re-configurations, and software updates. Therefore, we surveyed the literature for concepts and methods needed to automatically establish sos with purposeful cps communication, focusing on machine learning and connecting approaches that are not integrated in the present literature. Here, we summarize recent developments relevant to the dynamic interoperability problem, such as representation learning for ontology alignment and inference on heterogeneous linked data; neural networks for transcoding of text and code; concept learning-based reasoning; and emergent communication. We find that there has been a recent interest in deep learning approaches to establishing communication under different assumptions about the environment, language, and nature of the communicating entities. Furthermore, we present examples of architectures and discuss open problems associated with ai-enabled solutions in relation to sos interoperability requirements. Although these developments open new avenues for research, there are still no examples that bridge the concepts necessary to establish dynamic interoperability in complex sos, and realistic testbeds are needed.},

It is expected that blockchain will play an important role in the transition to the smart grid. The blockchain applications in the electricity sector can be classified to optimizing existing processes like metering and billing or grid management and using blockchain for emerging applications such as creating new platforms for value exchange like peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading. This paper briefly introduces the fundamentals of blockchain technology, such as different types of blockchain networks and consensus mechanisms, in addition to introducing a few blockchain platforms that are widely used in current studies, projects, and startups or may have future potential in the electricity sector applications. The contribution of this paper is to provide a review of potential applications of blockchain in many electricity sector use cases, and they are categorized into eight categories such as P2P energy trading, wholesale markets, retail markets, metering and billing, trading of renewable energy certificates (RECs) and carbon credits, electric mobility, enhancement of power system cyber security, investments in renewable energy sources (RESs), and power system operation and management. Moreover, examples of research studies, pilot projects, industrial projects, startups, or companies investigating the blockchain capabilities at each potential application are introduced. Furthermore, the studies presented in each use case are compared to clarify and highlight the blockchain functions and involved actors. Finally, the paper discusses the challenges that blockchain technology is facing that obstruct large-scale adoption in different sectors and in the electricity sector specifically and potential solutions to these challenges that are being developed.},

  abstract = {Amid global health challenges, resilient health systems require continuous innovation and progress. Stakeholders highlight the critical role of digital technologies in accelerating this progress. However, the digital health field faces significant challenges, including the sensitivity of health data, the absence of evidence-based standards, data governance issues, and a lack of evidence on the impact of digital health strategies. Overcoming these challenges is crucial to unlocking the full potential of digital health innovations in enhancing healthcare delivery and outcomes. Prioritizing security and privacy is essential in developing digital health solutions that are transparent, accessible, and effective. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have gained widespread attention, including in healthcare, offering innovative solutions and addressing challenges through blockchain technology. This paper addresses the gap in systematic-level studies on NFT applications in healthcare, aiming to comprehensively analyze use cases and associated research challenges. The search included primary studies published between 2014 and November 2023, searching in a balanced set of databases compiling articles from different fields. A review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework and strictly focusing on research articles related to NFT applications in the healthcare sector. The electronic search retrieved 1902 articles, ultimately resulting in 15 articles for data extraction. These articles span applications of NFTs in medical devices, pathology exams, diagnosis, pharmaceuticals, and other healthcare domains, highlighting their potential to eliminate centralized trust sources in health informatics. The review emphasizes the adaptability and versatility of NFT-based solutions, indicating their broader applicability across various healthcare stages and expansion into diverse industries.

With advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), there is a growing opportunity to enhance the efficiency, accuracy, and comprehensiveness of smart contract auditing. This research explores how AI technologies such as machine learning, natural language processing, and symbolic reasoning are being applied to smart contract auditing. It examines the limitations of traditional methods, proposes a framework for AI-enhanced auditing, and discusses potential benefits and challenges. The findings suggest that AI has the potential to transform the smart contract auditing landscape by providing dynamic, real-time, and adaptive tools that address both known and emerging vulnerabilities.},

While there is no consensus definition yet, 'crypto-games' commonly denotes games that store tokens, e.g. in-game items, on a distributed ledger atop a cryptocurrency network. This enables the trading of game items for cryptocurrency, which can then be exchanged for regular currency. Together with their chance-based mechanics, this makes crypto-games part of the recent convergence of digital gaming and gambling. In a first effort to scope the field, this paper surveys popular crypto-games, which use the Ethereum cryptocurrency, to tease out characteristic technical properties and gameplay. It then compares the games' features with criteria found in current legal and psychological definitions of gambling. We find that the popular crypto-games selected meet a combined legal and psychological definition of gambling, and conclude with ramifications for future research.},

To review and verify the project specifications and source code with a detailed focus on weaknesses, potential vulnerabilities, and overall security the procedure of findings with solutions that may mitigate future attacks or loopholes must be provided by auditors. The mission of this document is to define the different types of approaches and detections, ranging from manual, static, and dynamic analysis, as well as formal verification, to ensure that a protocol using smart contracts is checked against known attacks and common potential vulnerabilities. A smart contract audit involves security experts to scrutinize the source code created to underwrite the functions of the smart contract often called a decentralized protocol. Smart contract audits are usually conducted by a third-party company to ensure that the source code is reviewed as thoroughly as possible. Depending on the complexity of the smart contract, companies may choose to engage the services of a specialist smart contract team to conduct the audit without being sure that the auditing process is well conducted. The importance of getting the smart contract code correct and secure before it is deployed is very important even more due to the immutability of blockchain and distributed ledger system. The implications of activating a smart contract that has not been properly audited could be severe for any projects. The contribution helps to the emerging literature on audit data analytics (ADA) by proposing a new approach involving audit methodology, audit analytic tools and smart audit procedures which are enabled by blockchain technology. Besides, this contribution presents a discussion regarding the effect of smart audit procedures on audit quality and the public/private interest regarding the role of emerging technologies in the traditional system audit process bring by a new emerging cybersecurity market.},

  abstract = {The increasing trend of energy generation and management systems towards decentralized structures such as using renewable energy resources makes it necessary to use digital and smart platforms for exchanging information and even conducting financial transactions in a decentralized manner, known as the peer-to-peer model. The decentralized transaction verification of cryptocurrencies makes it possible to use these encrypted currencies and decentralized blockchain networks in energy management systems and carry out financial transactions related to carbon trading. Carbon and other greenhouse gas (GHG) emission trading systems reduce the competitiveness of fossil fuel projects in the market and accelerate investment in low-carbon energy sources such as wind and photovoltaic power generation units. This market mechanism allows large entities such as countries and companies that emit GHGs into the atmosphere to buy and sell these gases. This paper reviews the blockchain solutions developed for carbon markets. Studies related to the design of smart contracts in the platform of blockchain are investigated. Special cryptocurrencies that are used in the field of green energy transactions and carbon trading are introduced. In addition, the application of artificial intelligence and game theory in energy trading is stated. The study of different blockchain frameworks for carbon trading shows that the use of decentralized platforms in carbon trading can have a significant impact on the trend towards low-carbon measures and achieving the goals of the Kyoto Treaty, increasing the value of green cryptocurrencies and the volume of transactions. These technologies offer a promising avenue for creating a more decentralized, efficient, and environmentally conscious energy ecosystem.},

  abstract = {Current gaming literature lacks empirical evidence on the influence of game design elements and the process through which game engagement can transition into addictive behaviors. Drawing upon the dual theory of passion, this research explores how game design mechanics shape the dualistic experience of passion (i.e., harmonious versus obsessive passion) in mobile gaming consumption. Our netnographic study involved a 2-year participatory observation of an online mobile game community named Empires and Puzzles, culminating in 10,927 posts and nine relevant forum topics. Seven interviews with game developers were also conducted. Our findings reveal that specific mobile game mechanics, namely farming, loot boxing, and raiding, influence the transition from harmonious passion (HP) to obsessive passion (OP) through a pathway characterized by pre-occupying, whilst the recovery mechanism that facilitates the transition from OP back to HP include alleviating. Such findings foreground the theoretical importance of moving beyond a static perspective of gaming engagement. This study contributes to information system literature by developing an empirically grounded framework for understanding the mechanisms underlying the influence of game design on the dualistic nature of mobile gaming passion. Persistent public criticism and government skepticism can impede game businesses. Our insights have the potential to generate positive social impacts by promoting responsible game design to alleviate resistance and skepticism.},

  abstract = {The use of smart contract technology is changing traditional business and industrial practices. Smart contracts, which are integrated into blockchains, allow an agreement's terms to be automatically enforced without the need for a third party to be contacted. Thus, smart contracts can lower risks, increase the effectiveness of company operations, and save money on administration and services. Despite the fact that smart contracts hold the potential to spearhead a new wave of innovation in corporate operations, certain obstacles still need to be overcome. Regarding contract law, there hasn't been much talk regarding smart contracts. Most attorneys still find it difficult to understand the notion of smart contracting, and programmers often see it as a way to do away with traditional contracts and contract law. An overview of smart contracting, e-contracts, smart property, and the contractual requirements needed to complete a contract are given in this paper. Theoretically, computer language doesn't need interpretation and might not even allow for it. What effects does this assumption have, if true, on the parties' intentions, the writing of contracts, the involvement of the courts, etc.? Based on that supposition, this paper investigates the effects of blockchain-based smart contract technology, particularly with relation to contract drafting methods, from a comparative standpoint. The common law method to contract drafting, which involves lengthy contracts with a "if..., then..." approach akin to the coding technique, partly stems from the need to shield contracts from judicial interpretation and interference. In order to make smart contracts "industry-fit" for banking, trade, and finance, this paper will look at how they can be positioned within the traditional Indian concept of contract law and how they differ from traditional contracts in the various stages of a contract's life cycle. However, the technological design of smart contracts opens up options that include automatic self-help, cross-border payments via CBDCs, and the enforcement of contracts that aren't enforceable by law. The independence of smart contracts from current contract law is precisely what makes many wonder whether or not contract law would need to be modified, and if so, what challenges would that include. By creating self-enforcing arbitral systems, smart contracts and other related technologies allow private parties to largely circumvent the recognition and enforcement processes that State courts often use to maintain some degree of control over arbitration. This phenomenon has the potential to make arbitration completely self-sufficient in the future, which would marginalize state courts. We shall enter a new era of conflict resolution without the need for a conciliator, mediator, or arbitrator or even without the need for a completely conflict-free environment as smart contracts get increasingly sophisticated and self-executing. It is argued, however, that disagreements are unavoidable. The question that has to be answered is not if disagreements occur, but rather, what forms of dispute resolution work best when it comes to blockchain and smart contract problems. While not the sole method, arbitration is said to be especially well-suited for a variety of conflicts and, if tailored to the particular requirements and expectations of (enterprise) blockchain and smart contract users, could be a key component of a blockchain and smart contract environment.},

  abstract = {The rapid development of blockchain technologies creates a new paradigm of economic relations, requiring a rethinking of traditional approaches to management and business organization. The relevance of Ethereum research is due to its significant potential for creating new forms of economic coordination that go beyond existing institutional structures. With the growing complexity of global economic systems, Ethereum offers a unique approach to solving trust, transparency, and transaction efficiency problems. The purpose of the work is to substantiate the role of blockchain as a new management technology using the example of the Ethereum platform, as well as to reveal the mechanisms for projecting imaginary autonomy in the process of its design and institutional-ization through the activities of various actors. The study focuses on the formation of alternative modes of economic coordination of entrepreneurial structures and social organization. Key characteristics of the "governance through transactions" implemented in Ethereum are identified, including the focus on exchange and association relationships, the epis-temological gap between the calculation and meaning of transactions, and the specific processes of forming and articulating these transactions. The process of institutionali-zation of the autonomy of cryptoassets is analyzed, demonstrating the complex interaction of various actors, technologies and social practices. A conceptual model of the evolution of digital economy management has been developed, reflecting the development trajectory from fragility to antifragility using the example of Ethereum. The trans-formational potential of Ethereum for existing economic and social structures is substantiated. This platform is considered an alternative proposal for managing the digital economy, capable of changing the fundamental principles of organizing economic activity. Problems and limitations associated with the implementation of decentralized systems are also identified, including technical challenges of scalability, difficulties of coordination , and risks of excessive algorithmization of social relations.},

Spect-NFT employs NFTs to authenticate ownership of spectrum bands, mitigating fraudulent activities and improving trust among participants. Additionally, Spect-NFT introduces digital Permission Tokens (PTs) to facilitate seamless spectrum sharing between primary users (PUs) and secondary users (SUs) enabling the sharing of a single NFT among multiple owners. We present a methodology for converting spectrum licenses into NFTs and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using the Ethereum Blockchain.

Despite the significantly improved scalability claimed by several high-profile blockchain projects, there has been little effort to understand how their transactional throughput is being used. In this paper, we examine recent network traffic of three major high-scalability blockchains---EOSIO, Tezos and XRP Ledger (XRPL)---over a period of seven months. Our analysis reveals that only a small fraction of the transactions are used for value transfer purposes. In particular, 96\% of the transactions on EOSIO were triggered by the airdrop of a currently valueless token; on Tezos, 76\% of throughput was used for maintaining consensus; and over 94\% of transactions on XRPL carried no economic value. We also identify a persisting airdrop on EOSIO as a DoS attack and detect a two-month-long spam attack on XRPL. The paper explores the different designs of the three blockchains and sheds light on how they could shape user behavior.},

In both cases the record in the distributed ledger, mostly a blockchain-based database, intends to serve as a proof of ownership or transfer of rights. NFTs might also add a further purpose, which in blockchain terms is referred to as ``a utility", such as access to special websites, chats or clubs in emerging metaverse platforms. This use-case paper presents a first introduction of two early stage demonstrators, set outside the common use of art images or images of historical events as NFTs. The first case shows how educational credentials can be created, in which different teachers contribute to assessment achievements. We elaborate how these partial achievements are verified separately within the actual credentials. In the second case study, we build on previous research in regard to NFTs in the music industry and show the combination of physical vinyl record special editions, in our case vinyls signed by the band, and the ownership certificate as NFT. For both demonstrators we used, in different settings, the crypto art platform NFTmagic and the blockchain-token wallet Sigbro. We developed and tested the results within the setting of a roleplay as a group and show how blockchain technologies and especially NFTs can be made useful in new ways, inspired by the ongoing process of discovering risks and opportunities in `crypto art', thus initiating discussion on the topic and effectively bridging the cybersecurity and (digital) art communities.},

To overcome the challenges posed by uncontrollable access policies in existing cloud-based access control schemes, blockchain-based access control schemes have emerged. However, most of these schemes still face challenges such as huge resource consumption and privacy leakage, which would not be suitable for large-scale IoT applications. In this paper, we propose a scalable and privacy-preserving access control scheme, named AccessChain, which combines blockchain, edge computing, and IPFS to guarantee secure and trustworthy access control while making it more applicable for resource-constrained devices in IoT. Considering privacy threats of attributes and access policies caused by the transparency of blockchain, we propose an attribute and policy hiding encryption (PP-ABE) to protect device privacy. By using smart contracts with the process, we can heighten the level of self-government. Finally, our theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that our AccessChain is effective and can be applied to large-scale IoT applications.},

Addressing the intricate nature of teaching and learning research methods presents a notable challenge with recognition that there is a dearth of innovative pedagogical approaches to teaching. In response to this, I created a board game designed specifically to cultivate a dynamic and enjoyable learning atmosphere within the classroom. Remarkably, no comparable product exists in the realm of research methods education, making this creation a pioneering endeavour in this field. By blending entertainment with education, this dynamic game serves as a powerful tool for enhancing comprehension and mastery of research methods. Offering a novel approach, the game invites students in entrepreneurship to immerse themselves in a vibrant and safe learning environment. Within this setting, students are encouraged to embrace risk in their decision-making processes, fostering an atmosphere conducive to exploration and innovation. Through engaging with fundamental principles of entrepreneurship including pitching, communication, resource allocation, risk management and competitiveness, players embark on an experiential research journey. This hands-on experience not only fosters deeper understanding but also injects an element of enjoyment into the learning process, making it both educational and fun. The board game: Context of entrepreneurial pedagogy Entrepreneurship researchers tend to have a prevailing preference for positivist approaches; however, this previously dominated methodology is being balanced with the recognition of more qualitative methodologies being adopted over time (McDonald et al., 2015).

  abstract = {Blockchain's evolution during the past decade is astonishing: from bitcoin to over 2.000 altcoins, and from decentralised electronic payments to transactions programmable by smart contracts and complex tokens governed by decentralised organisations. While the new generation of blockchain applications is still evolving, blockchain's technical characteristics are also advancing. Yet, immutability, a hitherto indisputable and highly advertised property according to which blockchain data cannot be edited nor deleted, remains the cornerstone of blockchain's security. Nevertheless, blockchain's immutability is being called into question lately in the light of the new erasing requirements imposed by the GDPR's ``Right to be Forgotten (RtbF)'' provision. As the RtbF obliges blockchain data to be editable in order restricted content redactions, modifications or deletions to be applied when requested, blockchains compliance with the regulation is indeed challenging, if not impracticable. Towards resolving this contradiction, various methods and techniques for mutable blockchains have been proposed to satisfy regulatory erasing requirements while preserving blockchains' security. To this end, this work aims to provide a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art research approaches, technical workarounds and advanced cryptographic techniques that have been put forward to resolve this conflict and to discuss their potentials, constraints and limitations when applied in the wild to either permissioned or permissionless blockchains.},

However, an open issue that slows the adoption of blockchain technology in the energy sector is the low scalability and high processing overhead when dealing with the real-time energy data collected by smart energy meters. Thus, in this paper, we propose a scalable second tier solution which combines the blockchain ledger with distributed queuing systems and NoSQL (Not Only SQL database) databases to allow the registration of energy transactions less frequently on the chain without losing the tamper-evident benefits brought by the blockchain technology. At the same time, we propose a technique for tamper-evident registration of smart meters' energy data and associated energy transactions using digital fingerprinting which allows the energy transaction to be linked hashed-back on-chain, while the sensors data is stored off-chain. A prototype was implemented using Ethereum and smart contracts for the on-chain components while for the off-chain components we used Cassandra database and RabbitMQ messaging broker. The prototype proved to be effective in managing a settlement of energy imbalances use-case and during the evaluation conducted in simulated environment shows promising results in terms of scalability, throughput, and tampering of energy data sampled by smart energy meters.},

A smart contract is an agreement in the form of a cryptographic code digitally signed by the actors. This technology holds the data transaction transparently and securely. The actors may benefit without intermediaries involved in the transaction. Supply chain management will be easily tracked by decentralized data sharing. Supply chain management involves transactions in agricultural sectors such as farmers, village cooperatives units, distributors, and consumers. The Cooperative is a party that buys goods from farmers and sells them to consumers. A smart contract is a digital signature that can access the system in transactions. The system records log activities that show the origin of transactions. All actors can see the transaction of agricultural products stored in the blockchain ledger in the Blockchain. This paper discusses blockchain-based Smart Contract scenario for supply chain management that is simulated and implemented in the Serious Game.

Various industries have started integrating this technology into their business models, resulting in the development of various types of blockchain networks. This paper reviews the latest academic advancements in sharding techniques within the various types of sharded blockchain networks implemented in the past five years to identify their strengths and weaknesses. The increasing volume of transactions in blockchain networks has caused issues in terms of scalability, transaction efficiency, storage, and security, which obstruct the global adoption of blockchain technology. Sharding in blockchain is a solution that aims to address these issues through various types of sharding techniques, such as network, transaction, or state sharding, along with the various types of networks and systems. The general definition of sharding is the partitioning of the network into subsets known as shards, which allows them to validate transactions in parallel, resulting in performance and scalability improvements of the existing network. The existing sharding techniques (before 2020) and the latest sharding techniques (2020--2024), along with their characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages, are also discussed. An analysis based on the performance evaluation of recent sharding techniques was conducted to further understand the impact of these techniques. The result of the review provides critical insights into the advancements in sharding techniques and fosters innovation while facilitating the widespread adoption of sharding-based solutions in the blockchain ecosystem.},

We systemize these vulnerabilities and their applicability to ERC-20 tokens, which has not been done before. Next, we use our domain expertise to provide a new implementation of the ERC-20 interface that is freely available in Vyper and Solidity, and has enhanced security properties and stronger compliance with best practices compared to the sole surviving reference implementation (from OpenZeppelin) in the ERC-20 specification. Finally, we use our implementation to study the effectiveness of seven static analysis tools, designed for general smart contracts, for identifying ERC-20 specific vulnerabilities. We find large inconsistencies across the tools and a high number of false positives which shows there is room for further improvement of these tools.},

Smart contracts require exhaustive testing to avoid such loss. Testing is to be qualified; hence mutation testing is the right choice. Mutation testing for smart contracts focuses on vulnerability detection by inserting faults in the code. Also qualifies the test suite executed against a smart contract. The pros and cons of various tools available for this purpose are discussed in this paper. Finally suggested improving the tools to perform the mutation analysis of smart contracts better.

NFTs, a blockchain-based technology, are distinct and indivisible cryptographic tokens used to confirm and record the ownership of digital and physical assets in an immutable and transparent way. The fundamental block of NFT is a smart contract built on a blockchain network. This contract contains specific information about the asset it represents, such as its unique identifier, metadata, and ownership details. The information is kept private and tamper-proof due to the decentralized and distributed structure of the blockchain, boosting faith in the token's authenticity. The NFT is gaining popularity, but it is still in the developing stage. There is a need for a comprehensive survey to guide future research and development in NFTs. Thus, this paper presents the technical components of NFTs, their features, and the minting process. Further, this survey paper describes different token standards for NFTs. It presents various applications of NFTs in healthcare, supply chain, gaming, identity verification, agriculture, intellectual property, smart cities, charity and donation, and education. The article also emphasizes the significant difficulties faced currently in implementing NFT technology from the viewpoints of ownership, governance, and property rights, as well as security, privacy, and environmental effects.

However, existing studies often overlook the resource requirements of blockchain consensus processing in typical Internet of Things (IoT) edge network settings. This paper presents our FLCoin approach. Specifically, we propose a novel committee-based method for consensus processing in which committee members are elected via the FL process. Additionally, we employed a two-layer blockchain architecture for federated learning (FL) processing to facilitate the seamless integration of blockchain and FL techniques. Our analysis reveals that the communication overhead remains stable as the network size increases, ensuring the scalability of our blockchain-based FL system. To assess the performance of the proposed method, experiments were conducted using the MNIST dataset to train a standard five-layer CNN model. Our evaluation demonstrated the efficiency of FLCoin. With an increasing number of nodes participating in the model training, the consensus latency remained below 3 s, resulting in a low total training time. Notably, compared with a blockchain-based FL system utilizing PBFT as the consensus protocol, our approach achieved a 90\% improvement in communication overhead and a 35\% reduction in training time cost. Our approach ensures an efficient and scalable solution, enabling the integration of blockchain and FL into IoT edge networks. The proposed architecture provides a solid foundation for building intelligent IoT services.},

  abstract = {The gaming industry, which predominantly depends on centralized platforms, faces growing challenges in protecting digital assets, ensuring gameplay fairness, and addressing online fraud. Conventional gaming systems store player data on centralised servers, including sensitive financial and personal information, making them particularly vulnerable to cyberattacks and security breaches. With gaming transactions frequently occurring on unsecured mobile and desktop platforms, player accounts are often at risk of theft, hacking, and fraud. These security vulnerabilities result in significant financial losses for players and developers, underscoring the urgent need for a secure, transparent, decentralized solution. In light of these challenges, adopting blockchain technology in gaming platforms has emerged as a promising and transformative solution. Blockchain's decentralized and immutable ledger offers enhanced security, making it nearly impossible for malicious actors to manipulate transaction records or steal digital assets. Research and practical implementations have shown that blockchain can effectively reduce online fraud by securely storing in-game assets and transactions on decentralized networks, ensuring their integrity and resistance to tampering. This paper makes several significant contributions to understanding how blockchain technology can revolutionize the gaming industry. First, it provides a comprehensive analysis of blockchain's security advantages, emphasizing its capacity to reduce online fraud and enhance the protection of digital assets. Second, the paper explores how blockchain enhances player autonomy by establishing secure digital identities and tokenising in-game assets. By enabling players to own, trade, and exchange their assets directly, blockchain fosters a decentralized gaming economy that grants players greater control over their virtual possessions. Finally, the paper identifies emerging trends and potential research avenues in blockchain-enabled gaming, offering valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities in this rapidly evolving field.},

Every person is increasingly concerned about global warming and, as a consumer, with their own individual contribute to that issue, wich may be measured by each one's carbon footprint. In this sense, it is only natural that each person wants to consume products with a lower carbon footprint, meaning with a lower environmental impact. For this, however, consumers need to be able to know the carbon footprint of the products they are buying. This is only possible by having every company tracking and sharing their own products carbon footprint. The blockchain is a distributed technology that allows for registering and sharing information between those companies and the final consumers. The blockchain is being used in many areas as a distributed database, and has some strong points like trust, transparency, security, immutability, durability, disintermediation and others. In this paper the blockchain technology is being used to track and trace back the carbon footprint of products and organizations. More exactly, this paper proposes a smart contract-based platform for the traceability of the carbon footprint of products and organizations.},

In later phases, when software prototypes are available, play testing provides more detailed feedback about player experience. More often than not, the realized and the intended game-play emerging from game software differ. Unfortunately, ad-justing it is hard because designers lack a means for effi-ciently defining, fine-tuning and balancing game mechanics. The language Machinations provides a graphical notation for expressing the rules of game economies that fits with a designer's understanding and vocabulary, but is limited to design itself. Micro-Machinations (MM) formalizes the meaning of core language elements of Machinations enabling reasoning about alternative behaviors and assessing quality, making it also suitable for software development. We pro-pose an approach for designing, embedding and adapting game mechanics iteratively in game software, and demon-strate how the game mechanics and the gameplay of a tower defense game can be easily changed and promptly play tested. The approach shows that MM enables the adaptability needed to reduce design iteration times, consequently increasing op-portunities for quality improvements and reuse.},

Blockchains are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems, such as Bitcoin, for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions. The innovation with a blockchain is that it guarantees the fidelity and security of a record of data and generates trust without the need for a trusted third party. This standard was chosen for the impossibility of offering fractions for sale on other platforms, ensuring the uniqueness of the proposed decentralized application. The main reason for the development is to create a module located on the network blockchain, ensuring the security of functionality with cryptographic algorithms from one of the most secure blockchain --- Ethereum. The task of development is to implement functionality that ensures the fulfillment of all functional requirements, the most important of which are the creation of a unique NFT to the user's property, its Fractionalization and the sale of fractions to other users.},

Examples of NFTs include art (e.g., image, video, animation), collectables (e.g., autographs), and objects from games (e.g., weapons and poisons). NFTs provide content creators and artists a way to promote and sell their unique digital material online. NFT coins underpin the ecosystems that support NFTs and are a new and emerging asset class and, as a new and emerging asset class, NFT coins are not immune to economic uncertainty. This research seeks to address the following questions. What is the time and frequency relationship between economic uncertainty and NFT coins? Is the relationship similar across different NFT coins? As an emerging asset, do NFT coins exhibit explosive behavior and if so, what role does economic uncertainty play in their formation? Using a new Twitter-based economic uncertainty index and a related equity market uncertainty index it is found that wavelet coherence between NFT coin prices (ENJ, MANA, THETA, XTZ) and economic uncertainty or market uncertainty is strongest during the periods January 2020 to July 2020 and January 2022 to July 2022. Periods of high significance are centered around the 64-day scale. During periods of high coherence, economic and market uncertainty exhibit an out of phase relationship with NFT coin prices. Network connectedness shows that the highest connectedness occurred during 2020 and 2022 which is consistent with the findings from wavelet analysis. Infectious disease outbreaks (COVID-19), NFT coin price volatility, and Twitter-based economic uncertainty determine bubbles in NFT coin prices.},

This research explores the complex Web 3.0 game ecology, where users actively create and regulate virtual worlds, moving from passive consumers to active producers. In this dynamic ecology, marketing tactics must adapt to new paradigms. The paper evaluates literature and suggests future game marketing strategies, notably for P2E applications. Several key studies illuminate P2E ventures' economic and governance frameworks, highlight blockchain technology's benefits, and analyse risks including deflationary reward currencies and unequal reward systems. Integrating Web 3.0 technology and marketing methods emphasizes transparency, fair play, and consumer protection. Additionally, digital marketing, game design patterns, and social media marketing are examined in advertising virtual items and computer games. Case studies in the paper feature P2E games ``Big-Time'' and ``Meta Theft Auto'', showing how gamers can make money from their interest and how reliable blockchain technology is. Games with diverse gameplay attract a wider audience, making them good marketing assets. As blockchain technology improves trust and security, P2E gaming allows gamers to monetize their interest. The possibilities for industrial expansion and diverse games attract more players. Marketing should emphasize responsible gaming and financial issues to attract varied players. P2E systems, blockchain, and different in-game vocations make ``Big-Time'' and ``Meta Theft Auto'' interesting games. These games' marketing should stress potential earnings, safety, gameplay variety, industry development, and responsible gaming, asking players to be cautious and study before playing.},

Secondly, I measure the influence of the `vintage' label on the game market in the first six months of 2018. I base my measurements on open market data available through such services as KittyHelper, Etherscan and the Chrome plug-in CKBox. I conclude that `vintage kitties' did not acquire surplus market value even after they became a publicly recognized part of the game: breeding them resulted in losses for the majority of players. However, their retro aesthetics inspired creativity of many players and signified the social status of ``the new rich''.},

  abstract = {Infrastructure maintenance is inherently complex, especially for widely dispersed transport systems like roads and railroads. Maintaining this infrastructure involves multiple partners working together to ensure safe, efficient upkeep that meets technical and safety standards, with timely materials and budget adherence. Traditionally, these requirements are managed on paper, with each contract step checked manually. Smart contracts, based on blockchain distributed ledger technology, offer a new approach. Distributed ledgers facilitate secure, transparent transactions, enabling decentralized agreements where contract terms automatically execute when conditions are met. Beyond financial transactions, blockchains can track complex agreements, recording each stage of contract fulfillment between multiple parties. A smart contract is a set of coded rules stored on the blockchain that automatically executes each term upon meeting specified conditions. In infrastructure maintenance, this enables end-to-end automation-from contractor assignment to maintenance completion. Using an immutable, decentralized record, contract terms and statuses are transparent to all parties, enhancing trust and efficiency. Creating smart contracts for infrastructure requires a comprehensive understanding of procedural workflows to foresee all requirements and liabilities. This workflow includes continuous infrastructure monitoring through a dynamic, data-driven maintenance model that triggers necessary actions. Modern process mining can develop a resilient Maintenance Process Model, helping Operations Management to define contract terms, including asset allocation, logistics, materials, and skill requirements. Automation and reliable data quality across the procedural chain are essential, supported by IoT sensors, big data analytics, predictive maintenance, intelligent logistics, and asset management.},

This paper presents a case study on developing a serious digital game targeting ``self-awareness among young adults''. By applying the RGD framework guided by design thinking, the study adopts an iterative design process, user empathy, and reflective practices to offer insights into integrating these frameworks effectively. The positive findings from user surveys indicate a strong connection between players and the game, suggesting its potential for future educational use.

Abstract. gaming and metaverse industries will likely increase blockchain users to two billion from 100 million [1]. Metaverses that partially evolve from electronic games infrastructure now are intensively trying to shape and try new economic models that will make new metaverse reality more stable. Play-to-Earn (P2E) games and metaverses incorporate their economy, commerce, and currencies. P2E exploded in popularity, generating over \$1 billion in total sales of tokens [2]. Crypto-powered gaming projects suffer from one key issue: the life cycle of a token is tied to the life cycle of the project. To avoid pitfalls, the new Play-to-Hash concept is proposed that ties tokens to an already established economy: Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency mining. Play-to-Hash protocol as a key part Play-to-Hash concept will allow metaverses and games fast adopt a new economic model with real decentralized guarantees as their rewards in Bitcoins as the most reliable decentralized asset. {\cyrchar\CYRK}{\cyrchar\cyrl}{\cyrchar\cyryu}{\cyrchar\cyrch}{\cyrchar\cyre}{\cyrchar\cyrv}{\cyrchar\cyrery}{\cyrchar\cyre} {\cyrchar\cyrs}{\cyrchar\cyrl}{\cyrchar\cyro}{\cyrchar\cyrv}{\cyrchar\cyra}: {\cyrchar\cyrb}{\cyrchar\cyrl}{\cyrchar\cyro}{\cyrchar\cyrk}{\cyrchar\cyrch}{\cyrchar\cyre}{\cyrchar\cyrishrt}{\cyrchar\cyrn}, {\cyrchar\cyri}{\cyrchar\cyrg}{\cyrchar\cyrr}{\cyrchar\cyro}{\cyrchar\cyrv}{\cyrchar\cyra}{\cyrchar\cyrya} {\cyrchar\cyri}{\cyrchar\cyrn}{\cyrchar\cyrd}{\cyrchar\cyru}{\cyrchar\cyrs}{\cyrchar\cyrt}{\cyrchar\cyrr}{\cyrchar\cyri}{\cyrchar\cyrya}, {\cyrchar\cyrm}{\cyrchar\cyre}{\cyrchar\cyrt}{\cyrchar\cyra}{\cyrchar\cyrv}{\cyrchar\cyrs}{\cyrchar\cyre}{\cyrchar\cyrl}{\cyrchar\cyre}{\cyrchar\cyrn}{\cyrchar\cyrn}{\cyrchar\cyrery}{\cyrchar\cyre}, Play-to-Earn, Play-to-Hash, {\cyrchar\cyrm}{\cyrchar\cyra}{\cyrchar\cyrishrt}-{\cyrchar\cyrn}{\cyrchar\cyri}{\cyrchar\cyrn}{\cyrchar\cyrg}, {\cyrchar\CYRB}{\cyrchar\cyri}{\cyrchar\cyrt}{\cyrchar\cyrk}{\cyrchar\cyro}{\cyrchar\cyri}{\cyrchar\cyrn}.},

  abstract = {Blockchain-based games have introduced novel economic models that blend traditional gaming with decentralized ownership and financial incentives, leading to the rapid emergence of the GameFi sector. However, despite their innovative appeal, these games face significant challenges, particularly in terms of market stability, player retention, and the sustainability of token value. This paper explores the evolution of blockchain games and identifies key shortcomings in current tokenomics models using entropy increase theory. We propose two new models - ServerFi, which emphasizes Privatization through Asset Synthesis, and a model focused on Continuous Rewards for High-Retention Players. These models are formalized into mathematical frameworks and validated through group behavior simulation experiments. Our findings indicate that the ServerFi is particularly effective in maintaining player engagement and ensuring the long-term viability of the gaming ecosystem, offering a promising direction for future blockchain game development.},

NFTs have emerged as a game-changer by endowing players with authentic ownership of in-game assets, unlocking unbridled creative potential, and nurturing player-centric economies. Simultaneously, AI has taken gaming experiences to unparalleled heights, seamlessly tailoring gameplay to individual preferences, ushering in stunning graphics realism, and providing in-depth analytical insights. However, this dynamic union is not without its challenges. Market volatility within the NFT space demands careful consideration to ensure both players and developers navigate this nascent terrain judiciously. Ensuring fairness in NFT-driven gaming ecosystems is imperative to maintain gameplay balance and overall player satisfaction. Additionally, concerns about the environmental sustainability of blockchain technologies, often underpinning NFTs, must be addressed through innovative, eco-friendly solutions. As the gaming industry continues its inexorable march forward, the synergy between NFTs and AI holds the promise of fundamentally redefining player engagement, innovation, and immersion. Players find themselves in worlds crafted precisely to their desires, where their virtual possessions hold tangible real-world value. Yet, it is essential for stakeholders to deftly navigate the evolving landscape, embracing the multitude of opportunities and complexities that shape the future of gaming. This fusion of NFTs and AI marks a watershed moment, poised to reshape the gaming landscape profoundly and usher in an era of unprecedented possibilities.},

  abstract = {Background China is striving to promote a hierarchical medical system (HMS) to improve the efficiency of health resource utilization and ensure health equity. An innovative payment scheme named the ``Diagnosis-Intervention Package'' (DIP) has been developed recently and implemented in 71 pilot cities nationwide. Although the impact of payment reform on medical expenditure and provider behavior has been demonstrated, there is little evidence on whether the reform promotes the HMS. Methods This study uses evolutionary game theory to formulate a tripartite evolutionary game model involving the local government (LG), superior medical institutions (SMI), and patients in implementing DIP payment reform. We also analyze the stability of each participant's strategy and the sensitivity of parameters. Results The results show that for LG, the additional social benefits created for other regions are crucial in influencing the evolution of the game system. SMI are more inclined to support the HMS when the proportion of patient reduction under the DIP payment scheme is low. For patients, the perceived medical quality of primary medical institutions (PMI) is the decisive factor in their strategies. Conclusion The DIP payment scheme is more likely to promote the HMS in regions with an advanced policy framework, abundant medical resources, and high-quality primary medical services. Policymakers need to create effective incentives to boost support for the HMS from each participant. This study provides a feasible methodology for analyzing the impact of payment reforms that can be used in future research.},

  abstract = {There is evidence that blockchain plays a crucial role in the Internet of Things (IoT)-based implementation due to its transparency, traceability, and immutability, in which the participants are incentivized to behave authentically and precisely for rewards. Despite the domination of subsidy in reward, the decrease of the mining rate and the imperativeness of fees make the fee market become a pivotal role to motivate miners in the blockchain. However, the current mechanism for selecting transactions into a block poses a risk to the stability of the system, which stems from the vicious competition of users and the insufficient incentives of miners. In this article, we propose a novel transaction selection mechanism by leveraging the Lyapunov optimization and large deviation theory. This article is: 1) fair because the proposed mechanism is not single-factor dominated, both personal utility of the miner and overall utility of the system are taken into account; 2) sustainable since miners are incentivized greatly to guarantee the mining behavior; and 3) robust. The analysis based on the large deviation theory enhances the robustness of the blockchain. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to consider both miner's benefit as well as system benefit to establish a better fee market in the blockchain for IoT enhancement. Our theoretical analyses and simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism.},

We consider a dynamic game model of the bitcoin market, where miners or players use mining systems to mine bitcoin by investing electricity into the mining system. Although this work is motivated by BTC, the work presented can be applicable to other mining systems similar to BTC. We propose three concepts of dynamic game theoretic solutions to the model: Social optimum, Nash equilibrium and myopic Nash equilibrium. Using the model that a player represents a single ``miner'' or a ``mining pool'', we develop novel and interesting results for the cryptocurrency world.},

  abstract = {The Open Network (TON), designed to support Telegram's extensive user base of hundreds of millions, has garnered considerable attention since its launch in 2022. FunC is the most popular programming language for writing smart contracts on TON. It is distinguished by a unique syntax compared to other smart contract languages. Despite growing interest, research on the practical defects of TON smart contracts is still in its early stages. In this paper, we summarize eight smart contract defects identified from TON's official blogs and audit reports, each with detailed definitions and code examples. Furthermore, we propose a static analysis framework called TONScanner to facilitate the detection of these defects. Specifically, TONScanner reuses FunC compiler's frontend code to transform the FunC source code into FunC intermediate representation (IR) in the form of a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Based on this IR, TONScanner constructs a control flow graph (CFG), then transforms it into a static single assignment (SSA) form to simplify further analysis. TONScanner also integrates Data Dependency, Call Graph, Taint Analysis, and Cell Construct, which are specifically tailored for TON blockchain's unique data structures. These components finally facilitate the identification of the eight defects. We evaluate the effectiveness of TONScanner by applying it to 1,640 smart contracts and find a total of 14,995 defects. Through random sampling and manual labeling, we find that TONScanner achieves an overall precision of 97.49\%. The results reveal that current TON contracts contain numerous defects, indicating that developers are prone to making errors. TONScanner has proven its ability to accurately identify these defects, thereby aiding in their correction.},

  abstract = {Blockchain has received a lot of attention recently for its characteristics of decentralization, immutability, traceability, etc., making it a promising technology for the development of various applications, especially the management of various digital information. However, most current blockchain systems exhibit problems such as high computational overhead and centralization of power. Reliance on cryptocurrency in many public blockchain-based applications is another factor that has hindered the application of blockchain technology in areas other than the financial sectors. This paper proposes a new blockchain consensus mechanism based on the contributions of participants. The proposed consensus mechanism, which is called proof-of-contribution (PoC), quantifies user behaviors and actions in a blockchain-based application as contribution values calculated through an algorithm. The node that has the highest contribution value in each round of consensus gets the right to generate the next new block. PoC preserves the properties of decentralization and resistance to hard fork and does not rely on cryptocurrency, making it attractive over cryptocurrency-based consensus mechanisms like proof-of-work (PoW) for a wide variety of applications that do not have to involve cryptocurrency. Contribution values can be abstracted from applications and used in the underlying blockchain consensus process to improve the security and trustworthiness of the applications. Intellectual property (IP) protection is one such application to apply the blockchain technology and the PoC consensus mechanism. However, existing blockchain-based IP protection systems are mostly developed based on public blockchain platforms such as the Ethereum while some others are developed as consortium blockchains, thus exhibiting inherent defects such as high system requirements, long consensus delay, and low user participation. In this paper, we will use IP protection as the application scenario to illustrate the development of our PoC consensus mechanism and will compare PoC to some existing consensus mechanisms. Experimental results will show that the proposed PoC consensus mechanism preserves most of the main security characteristics of blockchain and is superior to existing consensus mechanisms, making it more secure and efficient to use blockchain technology for digital information management.},

Blockchain technology, despite its broad applications across diverse sectors, is often met with skepticism due to a general lack of understanding and incidents of illicit activities in the cryptocurrency domain. This study aims to demystify blockchain technology by providing an in-depth examination of its application in a novel blockchain-based card game, centered around renewable energy and sustainable resource management. This paper introduces a serious game that uses blockchain to enhance user interaction, ownership, and gameplay, demonstrating the technology's potential to revolutionize the gaming industry. Notable aspects of the game, such as ownership of virtual assets, transparent transaction histories, trustless game mechanics, user-driven content creation, gasless transactions, and mechanisms for in-game asset trading and cross-platform asset reuse are analyzed. The paper discusses how these features, not only provide a richer gaming experience but also serve as effective tools for raising awareness about sustainable energy and resource management, thereby bridging the gap between entertainment and education. The case study offers valuable insights into how blockchain can create dynamic, secure, and participatory virtual environments, shifting the paradigm of traditional online gaming.},

This review secondarily investigates the rationale for implementing game mechanics and the effects of these tools. A systematic search was conducted in Embase, Medline, PsycINFO, and Web of Science, from inception until August 30, 2022. Studies were eligible if focus was on the utilization of gamification in eHealth self-management interventions for young people (age = 10-25 years) with chronic diseases. Primary quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-method studies written in English were included. We identified 34 eHealth tools, of which 20 (59\%) were gamified tools and 14 (41\%) were serious games. We found that 55 unique game mechanics were implemented. The most commonly used were rewards (50\%), score (44\%), creative control (41\%), and social interaction (32\%). In comparison with gamified tools, the number and diversity of game mechanics applied were higher in serious games. For most tools (85\%), a general rationale was provided for utilizing gamification, which often was to promote engaging experiences. A rationale for using specific game mechanics was less commonly provided (only for 45\% of the game mechanics). The limited availability of experimental research precludes to test the effectiveness of using gamification in eHealth to support self-management in young people with chronic diseases. In this study, we highlight the importance of reporting the rationale for utilizing specific game mechanics in eHealth tools to ensure a proper alignment with evidence-based practice and the need of conducting experimental research.

However, the difficulty and high cost of financing have always been critical factors hindering the sustainable development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

Based on it, this study aims to establish Blockchain-driven incentives and restraint mechanisms for SME financing using a dynamic game model in which financial institutions (FIs) and new agricultural business entities (NABEs) are regarded as game subjects. By analyzing the impact of key parameters on the equilibrium state of the game for all stakeholders, several findings are drawn as follows. (1) The usage of BT affects FI loan strategies by influencing their cost in supply chain financing. (2) The usage of BT affects NABE's strategy choice by influencing their loan interest rate. (3) The usage of BT affects NABE's strategy choice by influencing their default losses. (4) The usage of BT affects NABE's and FI's strategy choices by influencing their additional benefits. This study provides decision-making support for optimal strategy decisions under different conditions and serves as a theoretical reference for the government in formulating financing incentive and restraint mechanisms.},

This trend is reflected in a slew of "play-toearn" (P2E) video games. P2E users can earn money by playing blockchain-based video games and accumulating cryptocurrency tokens and other virtual in-game assets, which are represented as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This paper argues that P2E gaming represents a new form of techno-economic rentiership that blurs the boundaries between work and play. Using the P2E game Axie Infinity as a case study, this paper explores how economic rents are being made in a digital environment and examines the role of labor in driving rentiership dynamics. Blockchain serves as a tool for generating rents by facilitating the decentralized production of a plethora of digital assets by individual users, where property and ownership rights of these assets are algorithmically governed. P2E labor is organized under manager-scholar programs and gaming guilds that allow asset owners to receive a cut of players' earnings in exchange for lending game assets. These labor arrangements promote community in the assetization process. Such a rentiership system is inherently unstable, relying on a highly financialized business model that needs to keep attracting financially motivated players who sustain asset values through their gameplay.},

  abstract = {Blockchain is receiving significant attention from academia and industries. Sharding is a promising approach to improve the scalability of blockchain. Each shard processes part of the transactions of system, and all the nodes of each shard need to jointly maintain a copy of the complete blockchain to guarantee security. The increase in throughput, however, comes with high storage redundancy, which poses enormous storage pressure to nodes in the sharding blockchain. Segments are introduced to alleviate this problem, where the main chain is divided into multiple segments stored by different nodes. Most existing methods assign segments randomly into the nodes, which may lead to high node set-up and segment query costs. In this paper, we study how to allocate segments into different nodes in each shard, with the goal of minimizing the total cost of node set-up and segment query. We formulate the segment allocation problem and propose a Segment Allocation algorithm based on Cost Clustering (SACC) for this problem. We theoretically analyze security, storage scalability, and some other performances of SACC. Simulation results show that the set-up cost, query cost, and total cost of SACC are less than those of the baseline algorithms.},

  abstract = {The popularity of digital games is increasing with a global market value of RM197.6 billion. However, the game produced locally still has no impact. One reason is that there is no emphasis on the game design process in the game development education program. Games designed have a problem in terms of creativity, and there is still no specific method of training creative thinking. This study aims to identify and validate game design's creativity components and develop a Creativity Training Model for Game Design (LK2RBPD Model) verified through the Game Design Document Tool (GDD Tool) prototype. This research has four main phases: the requirements planning, design, development, implementation, and testing phases. In the requirements analysis phase, the component of LK2RBPD Model was identified. The LK2RBPD Model contains elements from industry practices of game designing, creative and innovative thinking skills, creativity dimensions, Sternberg Creativity, and Cultural Activity theories. The GDD Tool prototype implementing the model was developed and tested. The LK2RBPD Model was evaluated using questionnaire survey, SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis, and verification of ideas in the GDD Tool prototype. Evaluation using a five-point Likert scale shows that GDD Tool prototype is effective in implementing 19 components. Expert verification on the results of game design ideas and creativity building using Cohen Kappa calculations is 0.94, indicating an excellent agreement. The results show that the LK2RBPD Model can be effectively used to train creativity in game design. This research's contributions are LK2RBPD Model, creative game design ideation process guideline, and GDD Tool prototype design.},

  abstract = {Context. With the development of blockchain technology and the increasing use of smart contracts, which are automatically executed in blockchain networks, the significance of securing these contracts has become extremely relevant. Traditional code auditing methods often prove ineffective in identifying complex vulnerabilities, which can lead to significant financial losses. For example, the reentrancy vulnerability that led to the DAO attack in 2016 resulted in the loss of 3.6 million ethers and the split of the Ethereum blockchain network. This underscores the necessity for early detection of vulnerabilities. Objective. The objective of this work is to develop and test an innovative approach for identifying and localizing vulnerabilities in smart contracts based on the analysis of attention vectors in a model using BERT architecture. Method. The methodology described includes data preparation and training a transformer-based model for analyzing smart contract code. The proposed attention vector analysis method allows for the precise identification of vulnerable code segments. The use of the CodeBERT model significantly improves the accuracy of vulnerability identification compared to traditional methods. Specifically, three types of vulnerabilities are considered: reentrancy, timestamp dependence, and tx.origin vulnerability. The data is preprocessed, which includes the standardization of variables and the simplification of functions. Results. The developed model demonstrated a high F-score of 95.51\%, which significantly exceeds the results of contemporary approaches, such as the BGRU-ATT model with an F-score of 91.41\%. The accuracy of the method in the task of localizing reentrancy vulnerabilities was 82\%. Conclusions. The experiments conducted confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed solution. Prospects for further research include the integration of more advanced deep learning models, such as GPT-4 or T5, to improve the accuracy and reliability of vulnerability detection, as well as expanding the dataset to cover other smart contract languages, such as Vyper or LLL, to enhance the applicability and efficiency of the model across various blockchain platforms. Thus, the developed CodeBERT-based model demonstrates high results in detecting and localizing vulnerabilities in smart contracts, which opens new opportunities for research in the field of blockchain platform security.},

  abstract = {AI tools can help a video game developer in designing and developing a video game by enhancing various aspects such as gameplay mechanics, improve graphics and sound, assist in generating content and therefore reduce workload and offer creative solutions. From procedural content generation to adaptive difficulty systems, AI algorithms are reshaping how games are designed, played, and experienced. As game developers, we are constantly seeking ways to push the boundaries of creativity and innovation, and AI provides us with a powerful set of tools to do just that. Research studies emphasize the potential of AI tools in game design and development, while also highlighting the need for further research and development in this area. Guzdial (2019) found that designers' perceptions of AI's role varied, with the AI prompting changes in design practices while Seidel (2020) proposed a conceptual framework for analyzing the impact of autonomous design tools, emphasizing the need to study their material agency in organizational contexts. This work delves into this topic, through the lens of a pixel art game as a case study, where we aim to provide insights into how AI tools can be connected to enhance the creative process and elevate the player experience. Our game is categorized as an Action-stealth (Espionage) single-player game, featuring pixelated graphics and a low top-down camera view. The game engine utilized is Gamemaker, with AI-generated graphics. The story unfolds in 2034, where a war for territorial expansion instigated by the Russian faction. Concurrently, there exists comprehensive control through fake news and misinformation facilitated by advanced AI systems employed by major global governments. In the game, the player needs to rely on some special mechanics to progress and neutralize enemies where he can crouch to be less visible and then go prone to move along the track without being detected. Moreover, he has binoculars to slightly enhance their field of view and rocks he can throw to distract enemies. Additionally, the player can draw his weapon to eliminate enemies, with a greater risk of failing their mission. We utilize a variety of AI tools for our work, each serving a specific purpose. The primary tool we employ for creating the game world is a pixel art generation plugin. This generates pixel art, including images, tile sets, objects, characters, and animations, based on provided descriptions and simplified sketches. Additionally, we use other AI tools for visual aspects such as character photo creation and concept art. For animation creation, we rely on AI tools that specialize in generating dynamic animations, character movements, and other visual effects for our project. These utilize sophisticated algorithms to automate * Speaker sciencesconf.org:3ai-24:544803},

  abstract = {Academics and practitioners acknowledge the relevance of integrating customers in the development of new products or services in terms of innovation and relationship management [9,45,69,80]. Engaging customers in the value co-creation process is advocated as a powerful means of establishing a dialogue with them [86], developing a community around firms' interests [41], strengthening the commitment toward the new offering, and stimulating positive perceptions and attitudes from customers [69], which can boost adoption rates and generally seem to considerably reduce the risk of innovation failure [66]. The emergence of online platforms, communities and social networks has been widely recognized as facilitating the interactions and the exchange of resources among actors [81,99]. However, even if these platforms play an important role [67], they are not sufficient in inspiring effective customer engagement, though they are considered key predictors of successful co-creation experiences [13,96]. Consumer engagement (CE) is defined as the level and intensity of the relationship customers develop with a focal object, such as a brand, community or process [13]. Described as a dynamic and iterative process of interactions, CE generates cognitive, emotional and behavioral manifestations [13,44]. Engaged consumers are more willing to promote, advocate, collaborate and share their knowledge with companies. They also tend to develop long-term relationships with companies [58].  Several authors have noted the key role played by interactive platforms in engaging consumers [8,51,81,82]. Ramaswamy and Gouillart [76] and Storbacka et al. [83] use the term ``engagement platform'' to describe such online interfaces. The platform design performs a key role in CE because it enables firms to provide a compelling co-creation experience to customers and consequently create, maintain and develop CE [14,30,50,53]. Despite the growing body of research on value co-creation [74,87] and CE [13,85,89], little is known about how to design interactive platforms to engage consumers in the value co-creation process [12,23,70]. Recent studies have called for further investigation of mechanisms that could be used to create, maintain and boost CE [11,14,23,50,70]. Among the multiple mechanisms that might be implemented to design engagement platforms, managers and researchers have called for the use of gamification [31,40,78]. Gamification is defined as ``the use of game design elements in non-game contexts'' [20]. It has recently emerged as a very popular practice that companies use to manage their co-creation platforms to engage customers, especially in online contexts [92,97,98]. For instance, Gartner [31,32] predicted that, in 2015, more than 50\% of organizations would use gamification to manage their innovation processes and that more than 70\% of Global 2000 organizations would use at least one gamified application for business purposes. This managerial interest is also reflected in research. Because user experience is at the core of engagement [78], gamification seems to be a fruitful alternative, as it provides users with an enjoyable experience and consequently generates engagement [78,97]. Gamification has found applications in multiple domains, such as e-commerce [49], healthcare [25] and intra-organizational management [27]. Whereas game designers predetermine gamification mechanics, which are defined as a game's structure, goals and rules, the behaviors and emotions that a game generates are difficult to predict. Consequently, the key issue for designers resides in their capabilities to develop mechanics that generate the intended emotions and behaviors [79]. However, despite the increased use of gamification mechanics for the purposes of innovation, it is still unclear how they influence CE [39]. Lucassen and Jansen [61] have called for a better understanding and appropriate management of gamification mechanics. However, the literature related to this emerging concept remains conceptual, and there is a lack of empirical studies analyzing the impact of gamification mechanics on user engagement [39,78]. Although recent works by Harwood and Garry [40] and Robson et al. [78] have provided some initial valuable insights, they do not consider the heterogeneity of users' profiles and consequently the different reactions users exhibit to a given gamification mechanic. CE is characterized by its intensity and its dynamic nature, which cannot be captured by measuring CE at one specific point in time, an approach that has been overused in previous studies [13]. The longitudinal design therefore seems to be more appropriate to better learn about how the intensity of CE evolves over time [13,43]. Our study aims to address this important gap, and to our knowledge, it is among the first empirical studies to adopt a longitudinal perspective, which is necessary to capture the iterative and dynamic nature of CE [13,44]. Finally, despite their important contributions, previous studies have devoted considerable attention to the emotional and behavioral manifestations of CE while overlooking the cognitive dimension, which remains an important aspect, especially in the specific context of new product development (e.g., Vernette and Hamdi-Kidar [88], Von Hippel and Katz [91]). To address these gaps, our research attempts to offer a more fine-grained understanding of the role that gamification mechanics plays in engaging actors in co-creation platforms. In particular, with this study, we seek to investigate the following questions: {$\bullet$} How can users be profiled based on their behaviors on a gamified co-creation platform? {$\bullet$} How do users' profiles predict current and future users' emotional, cognitive and behavioral engagement? Multiple gamification mechanics exist, but in this study, two of them -- cooperation and competition -- will be studied deeply. Within an innovation context, these two mechanics are widely used to design online co-creation platforms [16,30]. The competition mechanic consists of one player or group winning and the others losing, whereas the cooperation mechanic relies on players collaborating to achieve a common goal [92]. To empirically address the aforementioned questions, we use an in-depth case study, including longitudinal data and rich qualitative material. We first highlight the existence of multiple user profiles. We then assess users' emotional, cognitive and behavioral engagement with the gamification mechanics used, competition and cooperation mechanics. Our study contributes to the extant literature because it emphasizes four user profiles, i.e., invisible users, competitors, cooperators and coopetitors. Furthermore, adopting a longitudinal perspective helps us better capture the dynamics of CE over time across the various profiles and to study their respective reactions to the gamification mechanics. The subsequent section presents the theoretical background regarding CE in the value co-creation literature in addition to the literature regarding gamification mechanics and its impact. Next, we describe the two steps of our analysis, profile identification and engagement evaluation, including the data collection, analysis and results. We close by discussing the results, future research opportunities, and managerial implications.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the impact of blockchain adoption on online game supply chain pricing and enterprises' investments decisions under information asymmetry. Our analyses reveal that, first, with high market demand, enterprises will consistently adopt blockchain only when the quality input-output combined effect is significant and players' price tolerance after blockchain adoption is moderate. Additionally, when the quality input-output combined effect is minimal and players' price tolerance after blockchain adoption is larger, enterprises will consistently adopt blockchain with low market demand. Second, when players have a higher price tolerance after blockchain adoption, product pricing and platform effort in using blockchain can be enhanced regardless of the market demand state. However, when players have a less price tolerance after blockchain adoption, the market demand state and price elasticity will have a significant impact on product pricing and platform effort decisions. Third, developers tend to improve the quality effort of the game product in blockchain adoption when market demand is high. In contrast, when market demand is low, the developer prefer to raise the quality effort in using blockchain if and only if players' have higher price tolerance after adopting it.},

  abstract = {The market for non-fungible token (NFT) art is expected to reach USD 44.2 billion in 2021 and increase by 67.57 percent in 2022, revolutionizing the relationship between artists, collectors, and investors. Despite this, concerns regarding the environmental impact of blockchain technology's high energy consumption persist. NFT art transactions will continue to generate significant carbon emissions after Ethereum's ``Merge'' to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system in September 2022, rendering many low-carbon solutions obsolete and necessitating further research into post-Merge alternatives. This study identifies solutions in the NFT art market, such as carbon neutrality, lazy minting, alternative consensus mechanisms, Layer 2 solutions and policy interventions. Carbon neutrality is achieved through investments in renewable energy or carbon credits to mitigate emissions generated by NFT art transactions. Lazy minting reduces energy consumption by postponing the creation of NFT art until a buyer is secured. In the NFT art ecosystem, alternative consensus mechanisms such as Proof of Authority (PoA) and Proof of Spacetime (PoST) reduce energy consumption. By offloading transactions from the primary blockchain, Layer 2 solutions enhance scalability and reduce energy consumption. Carbon taxes and energy consumption levies are examples of policy interventions that promote cleaner energy sources in the NFT art market. This study will explore the role of artists, collectors, galleries, and other significant players in encouraging environmentally sustainable practices in the NFT art market. In addition, it will investigate the effect of prominent NFT art sales on carbon emissions and the adoption of eco-friendly alternatives. By integrating and optimizing current carbon reduction strategies, the NFT art market can continue to flourish while reducing its environmental impact. The study emphasizes the significance of implementing a comprehensive strategy that incorporates multiple solutions that are tailored to the specific challenges of the NFT art market.},

Through a literature review, this thesis will examine the barriers and opportunities of blockchain uses in trade finance, suggest the ways that blockchain technology could transform the trade finance system, and discuss the future of Blockchain Trade Finance.  Blockchain is shaking up the sector and requiring established financial institutions to adapt. If the recently developed applications are successful and interoperability issues are resolved, allowing for the connecting of various payment platforms, blockchain may end up being the infrastructure for financial services in the future. Blockchain has the potential to transform international trade finance, but smart trade requires smart standardization, which can only be accomplished through cooperation. If we are successful in creating an ecosystem that promotes the ongoing development of Blockchain, international trade, particularly trade financing, will go through a significant transformation in the next ten years.},

Utilizing the Ikarus Network infrastructure, sharding was implemented on masternodes as a key technology to optimize transaction processing. Sharding enables the blockchain to be divided into multiple parallel chains, significantly increasing throughput and reducing the load on individual nodes. The results demonstrate a 70\% increase in transaction processing speed, allowing the system to handle up to 5000 transactions per second, compared to the previous 3000 transactions per second. Network throughput increased by 50\%, ensuring more efficient load distribution and stable operation even with high data volumes. Statistical analysis using ANOVA confirmed significant improvements in transaction processing speed, confirmation time, and resource usage post-sharding implementation. The F-value for transaction processing speed was 4567 with a P-value of 0.0001, indicating substantial improvements. Visual data analysis further confirmed these results, showing noticeable performance enhancements in the blockchain system. Distribution charts and histograms of transaction processing speed and confirmation time revealed an increase in the average number of transactions per second and greater system stability post-sharding. Sharding not only increased throughput but also enhanced system security by decentralizing data among shards, complicating potential cyberattacks. The study aimed to determine how sharding can improve the scalability and efficiency of blockchain systems. These improvements position the Ikarus Network as a promising solution for scalable and secure blockchain-based applications, especially for tasks related to carbon emission monitoring and management. These findings can underpin further study and the development of more efficient blockchain technologies.},

  abstract = {We are often faced with the non-trivial task of designing incentive mechanisms in the era of Web3. As history has shown, many Web3 services failed mostly due to the lack of a rigorous incentive mechanism design based on token economics. However, traditional mechanism design, where there is an assumption that the users of services strategically make decisions so that their expected profits are maximized, often does not capture their real behavior well as it ignores humans' psychological bias in making decisions under uncertainty. In this paper, we propose an incentive mechanism design for crypto-enabled services using behavioral economics. Specifically, we take an example of a crypto lottery game in this work and incorporate a seminal work of cumulative prospect theory into its lottery game mechanism (or rule) design. We designed four mechanisms and compared them in terms of utility, a metric of how appealing a mechanism is to participants, and a game operator's expected profit. Our approach is generic and will be applicable to a wide range of crypto-based services where a decision has to be made under uncertainty.},

The increase in NFT transactions has drawn the attention of the art market to the consequent carbon emissions resulting from verifying transactions in proof-of-work blockchains supporting NFT transactions. With CO2-related deaths attributable to NFT transactions, social pressure from the art market has helped to progress the switch away from the deliberately polluting proof-of-work blockchains to more sustainable consensus protocols. Nonetheless, many popular types of blockchain have resisted the pressure to decrease their environmental impact, including Bitcoin, whose attributed 2021 annual emissions will produce emissions responsible for around 19,000 future deaths. In response, recent global policy interventions have employed legal and fiscal tools to reduce the carbon impact of some or all types of blockchains. Linking the damage caused by proof-of-work blockchains to climate change and human mortality, this study examines the recent policy interventions designed to motivate a shift in blockchain consensus protocols and promote miners' energy efficiency to mitigate environmental damage.

  abstract = {The rise of blockchain technology has set the stage for groundbreaking decentralized applications and smart contracts. Recently, there's been a surge in interest regarding the integration of social media data into blockchain-based smart contracts, promising significant transformations across sectors like finance, marketing, and governance. Essentially, this shift involves tapping into the vast pool of data generated by social media interactions immutable smart contracts. By capitalizing on blockchain transparency, security, and decentralization, this integration aims to streamline processes, foster trust, and unlock new avenues for automation and efficiency. This paper delves into the process of gathering data from YouTube, a prominent video-sharing platform, via its API for use in an integrating data into smart contract. YouTube boasts an extensive repository of data ripe for various applications. The research utilizes Node.js, Solidity, and YouTube API technologies. Furthermore, it explores incorporating this gathered information into a smart contract, enriching features within a decentralized ecosystem. The incorporation of social media data into a smart contract offers fresh prospects for data-driven decision-making and content verification, contributing to the advancement of blockchain-based applications and services. The process of converting data into smart contracts is divided into several main stages. The article also provides the results of execution time testing for transferring data from social media into smart contracts. The conducted tests showed a significant reduction in execution time thanks to the utilization of the YouTube API along with Node.js and Solidity technologies. This approach to integrating data into smart contracts can be applied for further analysis and content verification, fostering the development of blockchain-based applications and services.

  abstract = {Non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces enable users to mint and trade digital assets such as collectibles, trading cards, and digital artwork. Many of these platforms accommodate resale royalties, which return a predetermined percentage of the proceeds from future resales of the digital asset to the creator. While the adoption of resale royalties is seemingly beneficial for NFT creators by providing a recurring source of income, it may have unintended consequences on the sales price and liquidity of the underlying NFT, thereby affecting commission revenue for the platform. In this paper, we aim to understand the antecedents and consequences of resale royalties. Specifically, we empirically investigate the impact of minting costs on royalty rates, and subsequently the effects of resale royalties on primary market sales prices and liquidity. Our identification strategy combines a difference-in-differences model that leverages a policy change that eliminated upfront minting fees for creators and a large panel dataset from a leading NFT marketplace, and an instrumental variables approach. We find that NFT creators reduce royalty rates when they mint an NFT without incurring a minting cost. Furthermore, we observe that higher royalty rates lead to reduced sales prices in the primary market, suggesting the presence of a delayed gratification effect for creators in the hope of future royalty payments. We further investigate the underlying mechanisms and observe that NFT creators who are more confident about future resales lower their primary sale prices but are unable to recoup the losses in the near future, providing evidence of an overconfidence effect. Surprisingly, we find that the presence of resale royalties also impairs market liquidity despite reduced sales prices. Our work offers immediate implications for creators and platforms regarding resale royalty strategies and whether to enforce royalties.},

The presented framework can create evaluative profiles of the learning, social, game, and immersive mechanics of COTS games as educational tools. Moreover, the framework can position COTS games between four intertwined dimensions, namely pedagogical, design, knowledge, and sociotechnical considerations. Demonstration. To validate the practical application of the interpretive framework, we apply it to a real-world example. Our demonstration reveals the usefulness of the framework. Conclusions. The framework enables critical reflection on the game mechanics; thereby capturing the complexity of the game mechanics that makes COTS game both educational and fun to play.},

The decentralized structure offers inalienable security benefits, but with a large number of participants faces the problem of limited scaling. Sharding is suggested to solve this problem. Sharding is a way to divide consensual workload and transactions into several nodes. Effective application of sharding requires a lot of detail and work in terms of architecture and system implementation. As was found in the process of the work, in order to achieve significant results in scaling the blockchain system through sharding, it is necessary that the blockchain project is based on several blockchains simultaneously (i.e. had a multi-blockchain architecture) and provides infrastructure for fast and reliable messaging between them (i.e. strongly interconnected). The Telegram Open Network (TON) and its component TON Blockchain are considered an example of such a project.\&\#x0D; This work provides a comparative analysis of the most popular blockchain platforms (Bitcoin and Ethereum) with the implementations of TON Blockchain ideas (The Open Network and Everscale) on three parameters: system bandwidth (measured at transactions per second, abbreviated TPS), the average time of a new block's appearance in the network and projected bandwidth in TPS.},

  abstract = {Design research has increasingly taken an interest in inviting users and other stakeholders to contribute in the early phases of the design process. In the discourse of organising creative collaboration, design games have become a popular concept; the game metaphor has been widely adopted to describe several design activities, which at first glance do not necessarily share many similarities with each other. Thus, the concept of design games often leads to confusion about what is actually meant by it. Whereas previous literature gives various practical examples of applying a game metaphor (meaning calling what they do as `a game' or `a design game') in design, there are a lack of studies that address the following questions: Why are these same or at least very similar methods sometimes called design games and sometimes, for instance, drama inspired methods, scenarios or just co-design workshops? What are the underlying play-qualities embedded in the activities labelled as design games? This dissertation argues that in order to productively apply design games, it is important to understand their core identity by looking at the roots of the play atmosphere along with the play-qualities essential to it. This is done by studying games, play and performance separately and in connection with the application context, co-design. The three main perspectives adopted in this search are design collaboration, facilitating creative interplay between current practices and future opportunities, and design materials as tools in ideation. In doing so, this dissertation builds a Play framework that presents the elements and core qualities of design games in an extensive but compact way. The Play framework is developed by analysing several short-term empirical cases and a two-year design research project on co-design in relation to the existing literature on games, play and performance. The application domain illustrates the widening scope of design, including the recently much debated field of service design, through three cases ranging from recognizing novel partnership possibilities, understanding the evolving user needs during the long life span of bank services, and identifying novel service opportunities within social media. The research evolves by displaying the background, empathic design and co-design via five empirical cases and related literature in the first two chapters. Following that, chapter three addresses the question of what makes a design game, which is further explored in chapters four and five in connection with a service design research project. In addition, chapter five looks at the qualities of design games from the design game designers' point of view, emphasising designing creative collaboration as a design process in itself. The final Play framework is summarised and discussed in chapter six by looking at design games as a tool, as a mindset and as a structure. The contribution of this dissertation is three-fold: First, the Play framework offers theoretical and practical framework that helps to discuss, design, conduct and analyse co-design gatherings arranged through design games. Second, the empirical material provides examples of utilizing a set of design games that can be applied and further developed in diverse design research projects. Third, the way creative collaboration is organised through design games from the beginning formulates a specific design games driven approach for carrying out creative collaboration throughout multidisciplinary design research projects.},

  abstract = {The rapid adoption of blockchain technology in a number of industries, such as supply chain management, healthcare, and finance, has intensified concerns surrounding data privacy. As sensitive information is stored and shared on decentralized networks, the inherent cryptographic mechanisms of blockchain provide robust security. However, the transparency of public ledgers can unintentionally expose sensitive data, resulting in potential privacy risks and regulatory challenges. Differential privacy has emerged as a promising approach to protect individual data while preserving the usability of shared datasets. By enabling data analysis without revealing individual data points, differential privacy is well-suited for anonymizing transactions, smart contract interactions, and other blockchain activities. However, integrating differential privacy into blockchain systems presents several challenges, including ensuring scalability, balancing privacy with data utility, and managing computational overhead. This review, "Scalable Approaches for Enhancing Privacy in Blockchain Networks: A Comprehensive Review of Differential Privacy Techniques," examines 50 recent studies published between 2023 and 2024 that investigate differential privacy techniques in blockchain networks. It highlights various scalable approaches and their effectiveness in enhancing privacy. The findings indicate that these methods can significantly improve privacy protection, provide flexibility for both public and private blockchains, and assist in complying with regulatory requirements. This establishes differential privacy as a vital tool for secure blockchain implementation.},

  abstract = {Background: Health 3.0 allows decision making to be based on longitudinal data from multiple institutions, from across the patient's healthcare journey. In such a distributed setting, blockchain smart contracts can act as neutral intermediaries to implement trustworthy decision making. Objective: In a distributed setting, transmitted data will be structured using standards (such as HL7 FHIR) for semantic interoperability. In turn, the smart contract will require interoperability with this standard, implement a complex communication setup (e.g., using oracles), and be developed using blockchain languages (e.g., Solidity). We propose the encoding of smart contract logic using a high-level semantic Knowledge Graph, using concepts from the domain standard. We then deploy this semantic KG on blockchain. Methods: Off-chain, a code generation pipeline compiles the KG into a concrete smart contract, which is then deployed on-chain. Our pipeline targets an intermediary bridge representation, which can be transpiled into a specific blockchain language. Our choice avoids on-chain rule engines, with unpredictable and likely higher computational cost; it is thus in line with the economic rules of blockchain. Results: We applied our code generation approach to generate smart contracts for 3 health insurance cases from Medicare. We discuss the suitability of our approach - the need for a neutral intermediary - for a number of healthcare use cases. Our evaluation finds that the generated contracts perform well in terms of correctness and execution cost ("gas") on blockchain. Conclusions: We showed that it is feasible to automatically generate smart contract code based on a semantic KG, in a way that respects the economic rules of blockchain. Future work includes studying the use of Large Language Models (LLM) in our approach, and evaluations on other blockchains.},

However, one of the most persistent challenges that emerge in this decentralized ecosystem is the lack of efficient and secure interoperability mechanisms across different blockchain networks. The FlameShift Protocol introduces a ground-breaking approach to address this challenge, enabling seamless cross-chain communications through a novel Dynamic Asset Recycling (DAR) mechanism. This paper delves into the intricacies of the FlameShift Protocol, illustrating its capability to not only facilitate secure and efficient cross-chain transactions but also to enhance the liquidity and utility of digital assets across disparate blockchain ecosystems. At the heart of this protocol is the DAR mechanism, which employs a unique auto-burn and reclaim process. This process ensures that when assets are transferred from one chain to another, they are temporarily locked in the source chain, and an equivalent value is minted in the destination chain. This mechanism is designed to maintain a balanced ledger across chains without the need for centralized intermediaries, thereby mitigating the risk of double-spending and other fraudulent activities. Furthermore, the FlameShift Protocol incorporates advanced cryptographic techniques and smart contract functionalities to ensure that the asset transfer process is not only secure but also transparent and verifiable. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the protocol's architecture, security features, and the potential implications for the future of blockchain interoperability. By offering a scalable, secure, and efficient framework for cross-chain communications, the FlameShift Protocol paves the way for a more interconnected and versatile blockchain ecosystem. This study aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse on blockchain interoperability, providing insights and practical solutions for developers, researchers, and stakeholders in the blockchain community.},

  abstract = {Blockchain smart contracts play a crucial role in automating and securing agreements in diverse domains such as finance, healthcare, and supply chains. Despite their critical applications, testing these contracts often receives less attention than their development, leaving significant risks due to the immutability of smart contracts post-deployment. A key challenge in the testing of smart contracts is the oracle problem, where the exact expected outcomes are not well defined, complicating systematic testing efforts. Metamorphic Testing (MT) addresses the oracle problem by using Metamorphic Relations (MRs) to validate smart contracts. MRs define how output should change relative to specific input modifications, determining whether the tests pass or fail. In this work, we apply MT to test an Ethereum-based crowdfunding smart contract, focusing on core functionalities such as state transitions and donation tracking. We identify a set of MRs tailored for smart contract testing and generate test cases for these MRs. To assess the effectiveness of this approach, we use the Vertigo mutation testing tool to create faulty versions of the smart contract. The experimental results show that our MRs detected 25.65\% of the total mutants generated, with the most effective MRs achieving a mutant-killing rate of 89\%. These results highlight the utility of MT to ensure the reliability and quality of blockchain-based smart contracts.},

Examples of problematic issues and methods of solving them using the analysis of the proposed hypotheses are given. The purpose of the article is to justify the given method of using problem-based learning in lecture classes on theoretical mechanics using active learning methods. The main goal of higher education is the formation of competences in learners, which will allow them to constantly develop and adapt to modern requirements in the conditions of constant development of industry. The main emphasis is placed not only on the assimilation of knowledge, but also on its creative application, the ability to solve new tasks, analyze different options and achieve optimal results. Solving creative engineering problems in the style of a business game or a game session reveals and reveals creative skills and abilities, significantly increases the individual creative potential of most of the applicants and contributes to the formation of professional production skills. The work of students in such classes includes a number of actions aimed at deepening knowledge, consolidating it in practical situations and developing personal qualities, such as independence, creativity, responsibility, work planning, the ability to quickly adapt to changes and make adjustments in the work process. Active participation of students in this process is also important, which contributes to their intellectual growth and development. Problem-based learning is a method in education that actively involves students in finding, analyzing and solving real problems or situations that arise in the context of studying a specific topic or discipline. The main aspects of problem-based learning include: - active participation of students -- in problem-based learning, students act as active participants in the educational process. They are aimed at independent study of the material, problem solving and joint discussion. - stimulation of critical thinking -- promotes the development of critical thinking in students. They learn to analyze information, make hypotheses, solve problems and argue their opinions. - collaborative learning -- where group projects or tasks are often used, which promotes the development of communication skills, cooperation and mutual assistance between students. - interdisciplinary approach -- can cover different aspects from different disciplines, which allows students to consider the problem from different points of view and apply knowledge from different areas. - development of independence and initiative -- this teaching method stimulates independence and initiative of students. They learn to independently find information, formulate questions and find their own ways to solve problems. - application of skills in real life -- promotes the development of skills that can be applied in real life situations. It helps students understand how their knowledge can be useful in practical activities. These aspects allow problem-based learning to be an effective learning method that promotes deep learning of the material and development of key competencies in students.},

When talking about virtual reality (VR), numerous sources have discussed the optimization of interaction techniques, but there is a gap in research on the subject of gaming-specific VR interaction design, which we aimed to address in this paper. Focusing on the diversity of VR gaming, we introduced the term ``interaction mechanics'' and provided a taxonomy of interaction mechanics based on several criteria. Based on this taxonomy, we highlighted multiple target-related, task-related, and tool-related parameters that may influence the quality of interaction mechanics. Lastly, we presented the INTERACT framework, which was created to serve as a conceptual foundation for creating applications to be used as tools for user research, and used it to design an application aimed at facilitating the evaluation of interaction mechanics quality.},

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-aided disaster relief networks (UDRNs) leverage UAVs to assist existing ground relief networks by swiftly assessing affected areas, and timely delivering lifesaving supplies. To meet the growing demands for collaborative, trust-free, and transparent UDRN services, blockchain-based UDRNs emerge as a promising approach through immutable ledgers and distributed smart contracts. However, several efficiency and security challenges hinder the deployment of blockchain-based UDRNs, including the lack of cooperation between smart contracts, lack of dynamic audit for smart contract vulnerabilities, and low forensics robustness against transaction malleability attacks. Toward efficient and secure blockchain- based UDRNs, this article presents potential solutions: a series of collaborative smart contracts for coordinated relief management; a dynamic contract audit mechanism to prevent known/unknown contract vulnerabilities; and a robust transaction forensics strategy with on/off-chain cooperation to resist transaction malleability attacks. Our prototype implementation and experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach. Lastly, we outline key open research issues crucial to advancing this emerging field.},

  abstract = {As a critical raw material for the textile industry, cotton lint provides various types of cotton yarns, fabrics and finished products. However, due to the complexity of the supply chain and its many links, information records are often missing, inaccurate or lagging, resulting in low transparency and traceability. In the traditional cotton lint supply chain, the data of each link are stored in isolation; due to the lack of an effective sharing mechanism and the formation of ``information silos'', complete traceability is challenging to achieve. In addition, the completeness and authenticity of documents such as lint quality reports and certificates of origin must be rapidly strengthened. Otherwise, quality problems may arise. To solve the above problems, this study proposes a cotton lint supply chain traceability system based on blockchain and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), covering the whole cotton lint production process from harvesting to selling. We use an NFT as an asset token to digitise seed cotton, cotton lint and quality inspection reports and allow participants to store and manage these assets on the blockchain. The system design includes architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams and Ethernet smart contract development based on the ERC721 standard. In addition, the integration of Interplanetary File System (IPFS) technology solves the problem of storing large files on the chain and ensures that the data are permanently preserved and cannot be tampered with. We provide a diagram of the interactions between the system components and the four core algorithms' design, testing and verification process. We present an in-depth analysis of the solution regarding the transaction costs and smart contract security. We confirm the solution's security, reliability and applicability through a cost evaluation and security analysis.},

The concept of NFT originally comes from a token standard of Ethereum, aiming to distinguish each token with distinguishable signs. This type of token can be bound with virtual/digital properties as their unique identifications. With NFTs, all marked properties can be freely traded with customized values according to their ages, rarity, liquidity, etc. It has greatly stimulated the prosperity of the decentralized application (DApp) market. At the time of writing (May 2021), the total money used on completed NFT sales has reached \$34,530,649.86\$ USD. The thousandfold return on its increasing market draws huge attention worldwide. However, the development of the NFT ecosystem is still in its early stage, and the technologies of NFTs are pre-mature. Newcomers may get lost in their frenetic evolution due to the lack of systematic summaries. In this technical report, we explore the NFT ecosystems in several aspects. We start with an overview of state-of-the-art NFT solutions, then provide their technical components, protocols, standards, and desired proprieties. Afterward, we give a security evolution, with discussions on the perspectives of their design models, opportunities, and challenges. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study on the current NFT ecosystems.},

This limitation can be restrictive, especially when considering the integration of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products, where developers may have limited influence over the technologies used. The introduction of Federate Protocol in the upcoming HLA 4 standard addresses this issue by defining a language-agnostic interface using Google's Protocol Buffers. The Federate Protocol provides opportunities to increase cross-platform interoperability, while maintaining compliance with open standards.  In collaboration with Brunel University London, Pitch Technologies supported a project utilizing the HLA 4 Federate Protocol to enable Android mobile platforms to join and participate in an HLA Federation. The project created an Android version of a basic simulator and demonstrated interoperability with other versions developed for Microsoft Windows and Unreal Engine. The achievement highlights the potential to use the Federate Protocol to facilitate the integration of more gaming and COTS technologies into distributed simulation solutions; leveraging the use of widely adopted development environments, such as Game Engines, Web Frameworks, like JavaScript, and emerging technologies. This paper shares some experiences from developing with different programming languages to integrate mobile platforms and web applications using the HLA 4 Federate Protocol. Additionally, the paper explores some of the challenges that may be encountered using the Federate Protocol and potential solutions to ensure widespread adoption.},

However, their inherent vulnerabilities and susceptibility to bugs have led to significant financial losses, underscoring the challenges in securing smart contracts. While traditional auditing methods are crucial, they often fall short in addressing the increasing complexity and volume of smart contracts. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising solutions for enhancing software auditing by automatically identifying security vulnerabilities. Despite their potential, the practical application of these models is hindered by substantial computational demands. This paper investigates the feasibility of using smaller, fine-tuned models to achieve comparable or even superior results in smart contract auditing. We introduce the FTSmartAudit framework, which is designed to develop cost-effective, specialized models for smart contract auditing through the fine-tuning of LLMs. Our contributions include: (1) a single-task learning framework that streamlines data preparation, training, evaluation, and continuous learning; (2) a robust dataset generation method utilizing domain-special knowledge distillation to produce high-quality datasets from advanced models like GPT-4o; (3) an adaptive learning strategy to maintain model accuracy and robustness; (4) the proven effectiveness of fine-tuned models in detecting specific vulnerabilities and complex logical errors; and (5) a framework that can be extended to other domains requiring LLM solutions. Our experimental results demonstrate that smaller models can surpass state-of-the-art commercial models and tools in detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts.},

This paper introduces LLM-SmartAudit, a novel framework leveraging the advanced capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect and analyze vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Using a multi-agent conversational approach, LLM-SmartAudit employs a collaborative system with specialized agents to enhance the audit process. To evaluate the effectiveness of LLM-SmartAudit, we compiled two distinct datasets: a labeled dataset for benchmarking against traditional tools and a real-world dataset for assessing practical applications. Experimental results indicate that our solution outperforms all traditional smart contract auditing tools, offering higher accuracy and greater efficiency. Furthermore, our framework can detect complex logic vulnerabilities that traditional tools have previously overlooked. Our findings demonstrate that leveraging LLM agents provides a highly effective method for automated smart contract auditing.},

As the infrastructure of ITSs, vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) plays a key role in ensuring traffic safety while improving driving experience and comfort. However, VANET faces many challenges as the network is exposed to the public and involves sensitive information such as vehicle control commands and driving records. Although blockchain technology can provide such features as decentralization, immutability, non-reliance on trust and traceability, most of the existing blockchain systems impose high storage and computing capacity requirements for participating nodes while terminals nodes in VANET, such as road-side units (RSUs), on-board units (OBUs) and sensors, usually have very limited storage and computing capacity. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a blockchain system that provides scalable storage capacity for VANETs. The proposed scheme uses network sharding and multi-consensus strategy to improve the topology and consensus process of the blockchain. Aimed at lowering the storage requirement on the RSU nodes that participate in the blockchain, a collaborative storage mechanism and a dynamic copy number strategy for the blockchain ledger is designed. Experimental results show that compared to existing schemes, the proposed scalable blockchain storage scheme can significantly lower the storage requirement for the blockchain nodes, thus making it possible for the nodes with limited storage capacity in VANET to participate in the maintenance of the blockchain to prevent the blockchain from drifting towards centralization, and support maximal sharing of road traffic information while ensuring the security, privacy and trustworthiness of information.},

This game was used in a pedagogical intervention designed to help students enrolled in business oriented EFL courses at a Japanese university understand the process of value creation for images through game-driven utility mechanics. This process allows for the proof of ownership of an image to represent a value independent of the image and can itself undergo value appreciation. Non-fungible tokens （ NFTs ） are an emerging digital market in which intrinsically fungible digital images may be provided with a non-alterable proof of sale through blockchain technology. This proof of ownership allows for novel value creation of digital images in much the same way that the buying and selling of fine art creates value through the game mechanics of the auction. This research presents the results of a curriculum designed to teach about the value of images in a game of asset trading.},

This paper presents a blockchain-based FL framework that addresses these limitations by integrating smart contracts and a novel hybrid incentive mechanism. The framework automates critical FL tasks, including client registration, update validation, reward distribution, and maintaining a transparent global state. The hybrid incentive mechanism combines on-chain alignment-based rewards, off-chain fairness checks, and consistency multipliers to ensure fairness, transparency, and sustained engagement.

In this study, group discussions, case analysis methods, and the OpenSea database were used to analyze fashion trends among NFT products. A mixed method was used in this study. Quantitative and qualitative data derived from the questionnaire and group discussions were analyzed using the case study method, and the actual historical trading data of NFT products obtained from the OpenSea platform were analyzed. This study analyzed NFT products, fashion characteristics, and trends in NFT artwork. The opportunities and challenges of NFT applications and sustainable NFTs are discussed in this study. Our research results show that the most attractive NFT product types are collectible digital works and creative artworks. The critical design characteristics are lovely (cute), beautiful, and interesting. We recommend that NFT makers use the above-mentioned characteristics to create NFT artworks with special design characteristics to increase NFT values. The advantage of NFTs is that makers can freely create their works through the NFT platform, which can decrease the limitations of traditional methods such as the need for venues, exhibition setup costs, and intermediaries' commissions. The major challenges of current NFT applications include usability challenges, security and privacy issues, and governance considerations. We believe that our research results can provide useful directions and strategies for future researchers, makers, and ventures seeking to develop NFT applications. Our research results, such as identifying the critical design factors and current trends in NFTs, can provide guidelines for art design and innovation education. In addition, this study discusses the applications of NFTs in sustainable education, which can provide benefits for sustainable educational development to meet the goal of quality education in SDG4.},

  abstract = {Under the impact of global climate change and human activities, the occurrence of compound disasters such as cascading landslides and flash floods caused by heavy rainfall is increasing. In response to these compound disaster events, it is important to simultaneously transport emergency resources from multiple emergency rescue points to the disaster sites to promptly control the cascading development of disasters and reduce the areas affected by the disasters and associated adverse impacts. This study proposes a dynamic game model for emergency resources dispatch to comprehensively consider the evolution of the compound disaster states and the timely dispatch of emergency resources from the rescue points to the disaster site. The dynamic game model is exemplarily applied to the emergency resource dispatch for a rainstorm-induced compound disaster that occurs in the Guangdong--Hong Kong--Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Starting with the analysis of the characteristics of emergency resource management and the attributes of a cascading of heavy rainstorms, landslides, and flash floods, the game model simulates the dynamic game process between the ``disaster state'' and the ``emergency resource manager'' in the rescue operations. A two-stage dynamic game model can support decision-making with the objectives of minimal time cost and sufficient resource dispatch for the disaster sites. Game results show that the united emergency resource dispatch in the three GBA metropolitan areas can efficiently respond to compound disasters that occur within the GBA metropolitan area. The dynamic game model could be extended for compound disaster emergency responses with more complicated compound effects and resource constraints.},

While machine learning-based code generation systems aim to automate high-quality programming solutions, they face significant challenges when addressing blockchain-related issues. This paper analyzes the limitations of machine learning in identifying vulnerabilities within blockchain smart contracts and proposes robust solutions. To achieve this, this paper suggests organizing multiple security experts for labeling, developing efficient labeling tools, employing semi-supervised learning to reduce dependency on labeled data, and establishing a continuous update mechanism for labeled datasets to adapt to evolving threat landscapes. To address the scarcity of training samples in the blockchain domain, this paper introduces a method for generating additional Solidity smart contract training samples using data augmentation techniques. Given that traditional data augmentation methods are not suitable for Solidity, the approach involves converting Solidity contracts into Python code for processing, then reverting them back to Solidity post-augmentation, with provided code examples. Furthermore, leveraging established non-blockchain code to train blockchain-related models enhances model performance and generalization capabilities. These strategies effectively tackle the issue of insufficient training samples in the blockchain field and offer new perspectives on the conversion between Solidity and Python.},

Recently, NFTs have been gaining popularity and at the same time bringing up issues, such as scams, racism, and sexism. Decentralization, a key attribute of NFT, contributes to some of the issues that are easier to regulate under centralized schemes, which are intentionally left out of the NFT marketplace. In this work, we delved into this centralization-decentralization dilemma in the NFT space through mixed quantitative and qualitative methods. Centralization-decentralization dilemma is the dilemma caused by the conflict between the slogan of decentralization and the interests of stakeholders. We first analyzed over 30,000 NFT-related tweets to obtain a high-level understanding of stakeholders' concerns in the NFT space. We then interviewed 15 NFT stakeholders (both creators and collectors) to obtain their in-depth insights into these concerns and potential solutions. Our findings identify concerning issues among users: financial scams, counterfeit NFTs, hacking, and unethical NFTs. We further reflected on the centralization-decentralization dilemma drawing upon the perspectives of the stakeholders in the interviews. Finally, we gave some inferences to solve the centralization-decentralization dilemma in the NFT market and thought about the future of NFT and decentralization.},

  abstract = {The progress of computer technology has given the Internet of Things (IoT) a better development space, and also promoted the wide application of blockchain technology under the IoT. NFT (Non-Fungible Token) technology, which is a blockchain derivative, has also generated a vast amount of buzz with the meta-universe. The essence of the metauniverse is a digital twin space based on blockchain. The universe economy cannot operate freely. It needs to blend and interact with the real economy. The value anchor of NFT plays an important role in the metacosmic economy. In order to better play the role of NFT in the metacosmic model of different projects, it is necessary to study the metacosmic model expanded by NFT. Therefore, this paper focused on the green finance of the blockchain. By discussing NFT and the metauniverse, the idea of extending NFT under the green finance of the blockchain to the metauniverse model was put forward. Through empirical analysis, it was found that the method proposed in this paper has a more obvious effect than the traditional method. It promoted the actual asset growth rate of Item 3 by 3.7\%, and the digital asset growth rate by 4.7\%; At the same time, the rationality of resource allocation of Item 4 was increased by 7.3\% and 5.6\% respectively, and it also played a significant role in reducing the risk occurrence rate. This meant that the method proposed in this paper has a certain practical effect. It can improve the economic benefits of different project metauniverse models and promote their economic growth, thus bringing new opportunities for different industries. In addition, the research and application of blockchain technology has also enriched the application scope of the IoT, thus promoting its development.},

The research emphasizes the importance of using information technologies to create interactive products that combine high levels of graphic detail, realistic physical models, and user-friendly interfaces. The main purpose of the study is to develop software for a shooting simulation using modern tools and methods. The research identifies the key system requirements, describes the stages of project implementation, and proposes approaches to solving the main technical challenges. The paper provides a detailed explanation of the choice of development tools, specifically the use of the Unreal Engine 5 game engine and the Blender 3D editor. Unreal Engine 5 ensures high-quality graphics, efficient visual programming tools through the Blueprint system, and comprehensive developer support. Blender, as a powerful tool for creating three-dimensional models, was used to design objects such as targets and weapons. The choice of these tools is justified by their accessibility, functionality, and active community support. The game development methodology includes several stages: requirements analysis, architecture and interface design, code development, testing, and debugging. During development, modern approaches to modeling physical properties were applied, ensuring realistic simulation of shooting, including aspects such as bullet trajectory, object interactions, and acoustic effects. Realistic sound was achieved through the integration of high-quality audio files, enhancing the overall gaming experience. Special attention was given to the practical implementation of the game's core features, including weapon selection, target customization, the use of optical sights, and the implementation of bonus shots under certain conditions. An important component is the interactive settings menu, allowing players to individually adjust game parameters. The game was tested on various hardware platforms, confirming its compatibility with a wide range of devices. The results of the study demonstrate the potential use of this product for both entertainment and training purposes. The shooting simulation can be beneficial for training in shooting disciplines and engaging users with top-tier gaming mechanics. The work underscores the importance of integrating innovative technologies into the process of creating gaming products that meet modern standards of quality and convenience. Thus, the presented development serves as an example of the successful application of modern technologies in the field of interactive entertainment and demonstrates the prospects for developing such projects in the context of the growing popularity of virtual games and simulators.},

However, this phenomenon also challenges the existing copyright protection system. This research develops game models between creators and collectors in the NFT market, considering different platform reputation mechanisms. First, the potential for individuals to achieve cooperative equilibrium in repeated games is explored, and then the group evolutionary stability in evolutionary games is analyzed. The findings indicate that platforms with reputation systems are more effective in encouraging creators to consistently produce original works, which is beneficial for copyright protection. For individuals, the degree of importance that creators place on future profits plays a crucial role in fostering long-term cooperation. In this context, reputation systems can lower the threshold for cooperation by reducing the required emphasis on future gains, thereby fostering greater cooperation. For groups, in the absence of reputation systems, creators tend to adopt non-original strategies. Conversely, a reputation system can encourage originality when sufficient incentives and a critical mass of initial original creators are present. The research offers a game-theoretic perspective on copyright protection in the NFT market, offering theoretical insights for designing effective reputation systems on NFT platforms and serving as a reference for policymakers.},

  abstract = {As one of the key technologies of distributed ledgers, blockchain solves the trust problem in open network without relying on any trusted third party. Its decentralized feature has a broad application prospect, but still faces scalability problem. Currently, blockchain scalability bottleneck is mainly in three aspects: performance inefficiency, high confirmation delay, and function extension. For example, Bitcoin can only deal with 7 transactions per second averagely. Obviously, it cannot meet the requirement of current digital payment scenarios, nor can it be carried in other applications such as distributed storage and credit service. What's more, different blockchain systems carry different business and requirements, so scalability is the core issue of the current development of blockchain. This paper introduces the blockchain scalability related technologies from the aspects of improving efficiency and extending functionality of blockchain system, respectively. We summarize four mainstream solutions to improve the performance of blockchain system, including Sharding mechanism, directed acyclic graph based (DAG-based), off-chain payment network and cross-chain technology. In the end, we give some suggestions for further research in blockchain scalability.},

However, there are two challenges for NFT traders when analyzing the performance of NFT. First, the current rarity models have flaws and are sometimes not convincing. In addition, NFT performance is dependent on multiple factors, such as images (high-dimensional data), history transactions (network), and market evolution (time series). It is difficult to take comprehensive consideration and analyze NFT performance efficiently. To address these challenges, we propose NFTVis, a visual analysis system that facilitates assessing individual NFT performance. A new NFT rarity model is proposed to quantify NFTs with images. Four well-coordinated views are designed to represent the various factors affecting the performance of the NFT. Finally, we evaluate the usefulness and effectiveness of our system using two case studies and user studies.},

This study proposes a model in which software productivity improvement is investigated as a function of the factors affecting productivity, whereas team productivity is considered as a compatibility problem of distinct personality traits that should be situated in an efficient social configuration. The fundamental assumption is that the productivity is a latent construct measurable by a set of indicators and improvable by relating personality traits and team configurations. The two main contribution of this thesis is to develop an understanding of the factors affecting software productivity by empirical investigation and to build a personality-profiling test based on a psychometric scale specific to software practitioners. To assess the validity of our approach, we conducted a two- step empirical study in an industrial setting: (i) a psychometric survey on 216 software practitioners for measuring the correlations among the factors affecting productivity, and (ii) a domain specific game-based personality test on 63 participants for investigating the implications of personality types over the effective team configurations. Our findings indicate that software productivity is positively associated with social productivity and social capital, and can be measured by 21 different indicators identified from the literature. In addition, social aspects such as team size and individual's characteristics have a significant affect on productive team formations. A strong negative association is observed between social capital and the time practitioners spend in a software company. Evidence suggests that individuals in software teams become more extroverted while the effective configurations are still achieved with teams populated by balanced personality traits.},

  abstract = {Blockchain technology has revolutionized online marketplaces by introducing unparalleled levels of information transparency. However, it is still unclear whether full information transparency means information symmetry, especially in the novel setting of blockchain-enabled, two-sided marketplaces. In this research, we focus on the impact of rarity rank, a nascent feature in NFT marketplaces, on consumers' awareness of scarcity and the reduction of information asymmetry. Our findings indicate that the introduction of rarity rank for Profile Picture NFT (PFP NFT) on platforms like Rarible.com significantly enhances awareness and perception of rarity information. Surprisingly, we found this to lead to a notable decrease in the number of transactions by 11\% and a reduction in transaction prices by 8\%. Furthermore, by analyzing NFTs categorized by rarity levels, we observed a substantial impact on trading behavior in low rarity collections, resulting in the overall reduction of transaction volume and average prices. Conversely, insignificant effects in high rarity segments was found to occur because their rarity information is already perceived sufficiently. These results suggest that information asymmetry is mainly present in low-rarity NFTs before the introduction of rarity rank, and not critical in the high rarity segment. In conclusion, our research not only advances the understanding of information asymmetry in NFT marketplaces, but also offers valuable suggestions for platform managers and traders regarding how to avoid losses and maximize profits.

  abstract = {We present RPGBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) as text-based role-playing game (RPG) engines. RPGBench comprises two core tasks: Game Creation (GC) and Game Simulation (GS). In GC, an LLM must craft a valid and playable RPG world using a structured event-state representation, ensuring logical coherence and proper termination conditions. In GS, the LLM simulates interactive gameplay across multiple rounds while consistently updating states and enforcing game rules. To comprehensively assess performance, RPGBench integrates objective and subjective evaluation methodologies. Objective measures verify adherence to event mechanics and check variable updates without requiring human intervention. Subjective measures, such as content interestingness, action quality, and role-playing capability, are evaluated via an LLM-as-a-judge framework, where a strong LLM grades each candidate's outputs. Empirical results demonstrate that state-of-the-art LLMs can produce engaging stories but often struggle to implement consistent, verifiable game mechanics, particularly in long or complex scenarios. By combining structured, rule-based assessments with LLM-based judgments, RPGBench provides a new standard for evaluating how well LLMs can balance creativity, coherence, and complexity in text-based RPGs, opening avenues for more immersive and controllable interactive storytelling.},

While huge amounts of capital have been poured into these projects, the new crypto niche is considered controversial, and the traditional gaming industry is hesitant to embrace blockchain technology. In addition, there is little systematic research on these projects. In this paper, we delineate play-to-earn projects in terms of economic \& governance models and implementation and analyze how blockchain technology can benefit these projects by providing system robustness, transparency, composability, and decentralized governance. We begin by identifying the participants and characterizing the tokens, which are products of composability. We then summarize the roadmap and governance model to exposit there is a transition from centralized governance to decentralized governance. We also classify the implementation of the play-to-earn projects with different extents of robustness and transparency. Finally, we discuss the security \& societal challenges for future research in terms of possible attacks, the economics of tokens, and governance.},

The goals are part of an agenda for making progress on environmental, social, and economic issues while ensuring peace and leaving no one behind. Meeting these goals requires effort and innovation on all fronts, including technology. Information and communication technologies have long contributed to these efforts, and more recently, blockchain for good projects have begun to bear fruit. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are, in essence, certificates of ownership stored on a blockchain, can also contribute to sustainable development. However, to this point, they have been underutilised. NFTs have inherent capabilities that can make them ideally suited to contribute towards the SDGs. Their unique capacity to validate ownership, identity, claims, and history of events makes them valuable for a variety of purposes. To date, NFTs have been employed primarily for trading digital assets such as collectibles, in-game items, digital art, and event tickets. However, their affordances---the actionable properties NFTs offer to users---make them suitable for use in ways that can significantly affect the health and well-being of humans and the planet. This article provides a framework for linking NFT affordances with the SDGs and examples of how NFT use cases are addressing, or could address, these urgent global needs.},

In a system leveraging blockchain technology, specifically Ethereum combined with the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), personal and game-related information is kept confidential. This system ensures that only the respective users have access to their personal data on the blockchain. Furthermore, upon the completion of a trade, the information associated with the account can be altered once, enhancing security. Additionally, the landscape of video game trading, particularly in China, is evolving rapidly. With the growth and development of the video game industry in the region, it has become increasingly challenging to trade game accounts. This complexity is largely due to the emergence of various policies and regulations that aim to safeguard user data and maintain the integrity of game ecosystems. The blockchain-based system provides a more secure and efficient way of handling these transactions, mitigating risks associated with traditional trading methods. By employing decentralized technologies, this innovative approach ensures greater privacy, security, and compliance with regulatory standards, thus revolutionizing the realm of game account trading.},

The public data may be considered privacy-sensitive which sets a barrier to the wider adoption of NFTs. In this work, we present that the analysis of the transaction events can describe activities in NFT applications by establishing connections between transactions and thereby, it can identify information that may be privacy-sensitive. This can be useful in developing suitable privacy-enhancing methods for NFTs. We collected transaction data from a blockchain-based game called Planet IX that was built on the Polygon blockchain and used graph visualisation to provide examples for constructed connections.},

The findings show the application of blockchain technology can effectively reduce the regulatory and review costs for financial institutions, thereby enhancing the efficiency of supply-chain financing. Particularly, blockchain technology provides a more reliable credit endorsement platform for SMEs in reducing their tendency to default. The guarantee mechanism of core enterprises is more effective with the support of blockchain technology, which helps to build more solid supply-chain financial cooperation relationships. The research contributes to the theoretical research on the integration of blockchain technology into supply-chain finance, especially for improving the operational efficiency of financial services. It also highlights the need for blockchain-backed guarantees from core enterprises in optimizing supply-chain financial services.},

  abstract = {Data sharing is ubiquitous in the metaverse, which adopts blockchain as its foundation. Blockchain is employed because it enables data transparency, achieves tamper resis- tance, and supports smart contracts. However, securely shar- ing data based on blockchain necessitates further considera- tion. Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) is a promising primitive to provide confidentiality and fine-grained access control. Nonetheless, authority accountability and key abuse are critical issues that practical applications must address. Few studies have considered CP-ABE key confidentiality and authority accountability simultaneously. To our knowledge, we are the first to fill this gap by integrating non-interactive zero- knowledge (NIZK) proofs into CP-ABE keys and outsourcing the verification process to a smart contract. To meet the decen- tralization requirement, we incorporate a decentralized CP-ABE scheme into the proposed data sharing system. Additionally, we provide an implementation based on smart contract to determine whether an access control policy is satisfied by a set of CP- ABE keys. We also introduce an open incentive mechanism to encourage honest participation in data sharing. Hence, the key abuse issue is resolved through the NIZK proof and the incentive mechanism. We provide a theoretical analysis and conduct comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the data sharing system. Based on the proposed accountable approach, we further illustrate an application in GameFi, where players can play to earn or contribute to an accountable DAO, fostering a thriving metaverse ecosystem.},

Earlier research identifies the impact of ethics and society on the price prediction of CryptoPunks. Since the booming year of the NFT market in 2021, the discussion of CryptoPunks has propagated on social media. Still, existing literature hasn't considered the social sentiment factors after the historical turning point on NFT valuation. In this paper, we study how sentiments in social media, together with gender and skin tone, contribute to NFT valuations by an empirical analysis of social media, blockchain, and crypto exchange data. We evidence social sentiments as a significant contributor to the price prediction of CryptoPunks. Furthermore, we document structure changes in the valuation mechanics before and after 2021. Although people's attitudes towards Cryptopunks are primarily positive, our findings reflect imbalances in transaction activities and pricing based on gender and skin tone. Our result is consistent and robust, controlling for the rarity of an NFT based on the set of human-readable attributes, including gender and skin tone. Our research contributes to the interdisciplinary study at the intersection of AI, Ethics, and Society, focusing on the ecosystem of decentralized AI or blockchain. We provide our data and code for replicability as open access on GitHub.},

However, once the data in the blockchain is written, it cannot be modified. Ethereum smart contract is stored in the block chain, which makes the smart contract can no longer repair the code problems such as re-entrancy vulnerabilities or integer overflow problems. Currently, there still lacks of an efficient and effective approach for detecting these problems in Solidity. In this paper, we first classify all the possible problems in Solidity, then propose a smart contract problem detection approach for Solidity, namely SolidityCheck. The approach uses regular expressions to define the characteristics of problematic statements and uses regular matching and program instrumentation to prevent or detect problems. Finally, a large number of experiments is performed to show that SolidityCheck is superior to existing approaches.},

Their key envisioned uses (e.g. financial instruments) require them to consume data from outside the blockchain (e.g. stock quotes). Trustworthy data feeds that support a broad range of data requests will thus be critical to smart contract ecosystems.We present an authenticated data feed system called Town Crier (TC). TC acts as a bridge between smart contracts and existing web sites, which are already commonly trusted for non-blockchain applications. It combines a blockchain front end with a trusted hardware back end to scrape HTTPS-enabled websites and serve source-authenticated data to relying smart contracts.TC also supports confidentiality. It enables private data requests with encrypted parameters. Additionally, in a generalization that executes smart-contract logic within TC, the system permits secure use of user credentials to scrape access-controlled online data sources.We describe TC's design principles and architecture and report on an implementation that uses Intel's recently introduced Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to furnish data to the Ethereum smart contract system. We formally model TC and define and prove its basic security properties in the Universal Composibility (UC) framework. Our results include definitions and techniques of general interest relating to resource consumption (Ethereum's "gas" fee system) and TCB minimization.
