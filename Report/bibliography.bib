This study uses blockchain technology as an innovative element of the virtual items trading platform. From the perspective of literature research, the game virtual financial transaction platform planning in the context of chain technology is discussed. The basic structure and operational technology of this research planning platform, adding existing mainstream technologies to increase future expansion and integration technologies, blockchain technology will have a huge impact on the virtual trading of games. But strictly speaking, the impact of market mechanisms will be a huge challenge. The biggest impact of blockchain technology in the short term is the redistribution and integration of the game and trading platform markets. What is certain is that the role of blockchain in game virtual items trading is feasible for innovative business models.},

	abstract = {Today, digital asset ownership records are stored in a decentralized, distributed database on the basis of blockchain technology. It is no longer possible to modify any stored information on a Blockchain, which makes this technology a legitimate disruptor for sectors such as payments, cybersecurity and healthcare. Considering the increasing implementation of blockchain technology in various fields, this paper aims at focusing its application as a basic gaming experience to newbies, who wish to step into the world of blockchain gaming. Firstly, this paper presents the conceptual design and implementation of blockchain gaming in the framework of a 2D game hosted. This game highlights the incorporation of Fungible and Non-fungible tokens ({NFT}), which represent the rewards collected by the player. The collected reward bonus in the form of {NFT} is published on the player’s {OpenSea} account, connected to {MetaMask}. The Game flow includes the development of a user-friendly, theme-based interface supported by Solidity as a technological support for building smart contracts using {ERC}20 and {ERC}1155 token standards. {IPFS} (Inter planetary-file system) is used for decentralized storage of metadata and token images, and Hardhat and Alchemy for deployment and overall execution. This game demonstrates a basic implementation of blockchain in gaming and unveils its broader scope through its incorporation in even simple children’s games. This game carries pedagogical significance which can be utilized by the professors to demonstrate the practical usage of fundamental elements of blockchain to the students.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the impact of blockchain adoption on online game supply chain pricing and enterprises' investment decisions in situations of information asymmetry. Our analyses reveal that, first, with high market demand, enterprises will consistently adopt blockchain only when the combined effect of input-output on quality is significant and when players' price tolerance after blockchain adoption is moderate. Additionally, when the combined input-output effect on quality is minimal, and players’ price tolerance after blockchain adoption is more significant, enterprises will consistently adopt blockchain with low market demand. Second, when players have a higher price tolerance after blockchain adoption, product pricing and platform efforts can be enhanced regardless of market demand state. However, market demand state and price elasticity will significantly impact product pricing and platform effort decisions when players have less price tolerance after blockchain adoption. Third, developers tend to improve the quality of the game product in blockchain adoption when market demand is high. In contrast, when market demand is low, developers may prefer to increase the quality effort using blockchain if and only if players have higher price tolerance after adopting it.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{CryptoKitties} was the first widely recognized blockchain game. Players could own, breed, and trade kitties, which are the only prop in the game. The game gained explosive growth upon its release but quickly collapsed in a short time. This study analyzes its entire player activity history for the first time in literature and tries to find the reasons for the rise and fall of this first blockchain game mania. First, we extracted the five million transaction records among 100 thousand addresses involved in {CryptoKitties} in the past three years. Based on the numbers of addresses involved in the game each day, we divide the game progress into four stages: the primer, the rise, the fall, and the serenity. We construct a temporal kitty ownership transfer network and analyze the varying network parameters in the four stages. We find that a large number of players poured in during the 10th and 18th days since the game release and quickly exited in the following month. Since then, a few big players have gradually dominated the game, concentrating the game resources. Through further analysis, we find that the main reason for the rapid increase in the game popularity was the increase of public attention by media outlets, while the reasons for the rapid decline in the game popularity include the oversupply of kitties, the decreasing of player income, a widening gap between the rich and poor players, and the limitations of blockchain systems. Based on these observations, we advise on the further blockchain game design: (1) to finely control the production of props and avoid an oversupply, (2) to balance the gaming cost and revenue and protect the enjoyment of players, (3) to narrow down the gap between rich and poor and create an equal gaming community, (4) to consider the limitations of blockchain systems in their game designs.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Industries such as energy, transportation, and healthcare are already integrating {DLTs} into their operations. On the other hand, recent advances and the increasing popularity of the Internet of Things ({IoT}) technologies are also enabling new and exciting ways of interaction and sensing for mobile device users. Mobile gaming is another prominent industry that can be benefited from these technological developments and has the potential to create business opportunities. In this paper, we explore the uses of Distributed Ledger Technology in Mobile Gaming and for this purpose, we have taken a location-based {IoT} mobile gaming use case and propose new gaming features for the players by the addition of the {DLT}. We propose a platform for creating and playing scavenger hunt games using low-power {BLE} beacons. It allows smartphones to interact with the predetermined real-world locations and players can observe the surrounding environment looking for “clues” in the game. At the end of a hunt, the player receives rewards that are stored on a distributed ledger as Non-Fungible Tokens ({NFT}) and can bring in-game advantages for the next hunts. The proposed system is implemented using off-the-shelf devices and {IoT} beacons. We implemented our hybrid architecture by using {AWS} Lambda, Hyperledger Fabric managed blockchain and {DynamoDB}. We performed multiple experiments measuring the time taken for the end-to-end process, {IoT} beacon response times and the throughput of the Fabric network. Using the performance results, we estimated the maximum number of active players that can be supported by the game. Finally, we discuss business opportunities and limitations of the proposed proof of concept.},

Together with their chance-based mechanics, this makes crypto-games part of the recent convergence of digital gaming and gambling.

	abstract = {Blockchain technology allows players to own in-game assets and to be rewarded with {NFTs} or tokens for their game achievements, thus can be a game changer for all the gaming industry. One central issue is how to check that conditions for achievements are met (e.g., that the player completed level 10). Current approaches open cheating backdoors (e.g. if the client checks the conditions) or introduce centralization points (if a backend checks the condition). Ideally, we would like to “run” games on chain, but so far that has not been possible due to the high computational cost, especially on Ethereum; however, the development of technologies like proofs of computation can solve this problem. Being able to run games on the blockchain, new decentralized rewarding systems can be built to ensure the fair and transparent rewarding of game achievements.},

	abstract = {We are often faced with the non-trivial task of designing incentive mechanisms in the era of Web3. As history has shown, many Web3 services failed mostly due to the lack of a rigorous incentive mechanism design based on token economics. However, traditional mechanism design, where there is an assumption that the users of services strategically make decisions so that their expected profits are maximized, often does not capture their real behavior well as it ignores humans’ psychological bias in making decisions under uncertainty. In this paper, we propose an incentive mechanism design for crypto-enabled services using behavioral economics. Specifically, we take an example of a crypto lottery game in this work and incorporate a seminal work of cumulative prospect theory into its lottery game mechanism (or rule) design. We designed four mechanisms and compared them in terms of utility, a metric of how appealing a mechanism is to participants, and a game operator’s expected profit. Our approach is generic and will be applicable to a wide range of crypto-based services where a decision has to be made under uncertainty.},

We leverage the {InterPlanetary} File System ({IPFS}) and {NFTs}, backed by blockchains, to build a flexible, decentralized, and fair baseline system for trading games. Our solution creates a fully decentralized system, where new business models are enabled. In particular, we introduce and support the evolvability of ingame assets, enable their resale with dynamic pricing, depending on their rarity, and automatically provide a cut to the digital artists, without the need for a trusted (third) party. Our system guarantees that the in-game assets will remain online long-term, by orchestrating various decentralized services. Thus, users do not risk losing control over the artefacts or their value, even if the gaming company loses interest, or goes bankrupt. We considered and compared the Ethereum Name Service ({ENS}) and the {InterPlanetary} Name System ({IPNS}) as the naming component of the system and selected {ENS} for our solution, despite the fact it introduces monetary cost. Finally, we validate our claims and evaluate the feasibility and performance of the proposed system through a proof of concept implementation.},

The introduction of blockchain technology prompted a new generation of social media based on the concept of Non-Fungible Token ({NFT}) and other Web3 technologies, giving birth to the Metaverse. Decentraland is one such platform, where users can explore a 3D virtual world and communicate with each other. The main feature of Decentraland is that the virtual world is divided into parcels, implemented through {NFTs}, that can be traded among users and where owners can create buildings or mini-games for other users to play with. In this work, we explore the virtual world of Decentraland by presenting the main details of the virtual world and by focusing on the economic impact of {NFT} trading on the description of the parcels. In detail, the parcel's description can be used to advertise the proximity of the parcel to infrastructures or special projects to attract potential buyers. This paper's findings show the impact and the magnitude of this phenomenon, highlighting entire quarters that adopt this technique throughout the map by overriding the playful aspect of the platform.},

A smart contract is an agreement in the form of a cryptographic code digitally signed by the actors. This technology holds the data transaction transparently and securely. The actors may benefit without intermediaries involved in the transaction. Supply chain management will be easily tracked by decentralized data sharing. Supply chain management involves transactions in agricultural sectors such as farmers, village cooperatives units, distributors, and consumers. The Cooperative is a party that buys goods from farmers and sells them to consumers. A smart contract is a digital signature that can access the system in transactions. The system records log activities that show the origin of transactions. All actors can see the transaction of agricultural products stored in the blockchain ledger in the Blockchain. This paper discusses blockchain-based Smart Contract scenario for supply chain management that is simulated and implemented in the Serious Game. The Game is developed using Unity 3D Development Platform, programming language contract using Solidity, Moralis as Web3 Development Platform and {dApp} as backend blockchain, Network Environment Polygon Ethereum, and Database that is Redis Enterprise, {MongoDB} Compass, and Mumbai Testnet.},

As a result, a research model with nine research hypotheses was developed. The developed research model was empirically tested using data collected from a survey of 210 blockchain-based games users. Structural equation modeling was applied to analyse the collected data.,The results indicated that seven of nine research hypotheses were supported. It was found that trust, perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment and perceived ease of use were key determinants for users’ behavioural intention to use blockchain-based games. The most influential relationship in the research model appeared to be the effect of perceived usefulness on users’ behavioural intention to use blockchain-based games. However, subjective norms did not have significant positive impacts on users’ behavioural intention to use blockchain-based games.,The regulatory support from governmental authorities is essential to provide additional legal certainty to build users’ trust in playing blockchain-based games. Blockchain-based games providers should arrange the training program targeted to the general users to enhance their understanding of the key features associated with blockchain-based games. Blockchain-based games developers should come up with good design solutions to maximize user enjoyment with blockchain-based games by considering additional entertainment elements.,To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is first of its kind in investigating the adoption of blockchain-based games from users’ perspectives. This study contributes to the existing literature on the adoption of blockchain technology.},

However, despite their innovative appeal, these games face significant challenges, particularly in terms of market stability, player retention, and the sustainability of token value. This paper explores the evolution of blockchain games and identifies key shortcomings in current tokenomics models using entropy increase theory. We propose two new models - {ServerFi}, which emphasizes Privatization through Asset Synthesis, and a model focused on Continuous Rewards for High-Retention Players. These models are formalized into mathematical frameworks and validated through group behavior simulation experiments. Our findings indicate that the {ServerFi} is particularly effective in maintaining player engagement and ensuring the long-term viability of the gaming ecosystem, offering a promising direction for future blockchain game development.},

	abstract = {Blockchain games introduce unique gameplay and incentive mechanisms by allowing players to be rewarded with in-game assets or tokens through financial activities. However, most blockchain games are not comparable to traditional games in terms of lifespan and player engagement. In this paper, we try to see the big picture in a small way to explore and determine the impact of gameplay and financial factors on player behavior in blockchain games. Taking Aavegotchi as an example, we collect one year of operation data to build player profiles. We perform an in-depth analysis of player behavior from the macroscopic data and apply an unsupervised clustering method to distinguish the attraction of the gameplay and incentives. Our results reveal that the whole game is held up by a small number of players with high-frequent interaction or vast amounts of funds invested. Financial incentives are indispensable for blockchain games for they provide attraction and optional ways for players to engage with the game. However, financial services are tightly linked to the free market. The game will face an irreversible loss of players when the market experiences depression. For blockchain games, well-designed gameplay should be the fundamental basis for the long-lasting retention of players.},

While the peer-to-peer approach is very promising due to its independence of expensive game servers, a number of issues, such as state synchronization in an un-trusted environment, arise. Blockchain networks are a special case of a P2P network, and they have the potential to efficiently tackle some issues with P2P-based multiplayer games. However, blockchain development is a vast and complicated area, foreign to most game developers. In this paper, we present a framework to connect an existing game client to a blockchain network, friendly towards game developers. More precisely, we develop a middleware solution and a data model therein, to store the game state on a chain and communicate it to the game client.},

Blockchain technology, despite its broad applications across diverse sectors, is often met with skepticism due to a general lack of understanding and incidents of illicit activities in the cryptocurrency domain. This study aims to demystify blockchain technology by providing an in-depth examination of its application in a novel blockchain-based card game, centered around renewable energy and sustainable resource management. This paper introduces a serious game that uses blockchain to enhance user interaction, ownership, and gameplay, demonstrating the technology’s potential to revolutionize the gaming industry. Notable aspects of the game, such as ownership of virtual assets, transparent transaction histories, trustless game mechanics, user-driven content creation, gasless transactions, and mechanisms for in-game asset trading and cross-platform asset reuse are analyzed. The paper discusses how these features, not only provide a richer gaming experience but also serve as effective tools for raising awareness about sustainable energy and resource management, thereby bridging the gap between entertainment and education. The case study offers valuable insights into how blockchain can create dynamic, secure, and participatory virtual environments, shifting the paradigm of traditional online gaming.},

	abstract = {With the support of the blockchain systems, the cryptocurrency has changed the world of virtual assets. Digital games, especially those with massive multi-player scenarios, will be significantly impacted by this novel technology. However, there are insufficient academic studies on this topic. In this work, we filled the blank by surveying the state-of-the-art blockchain games. We discuss the blockchain integration for games and then categorize existing blockchain games from the aspects of their genres and technical platforms. Moreover, by analyzing the industrial trend with a statistical approach, we envision the future of blockchain games from technological and commercial perspectives.},

	abstract = {Blockchain and cryptocurrency are a hot topic in today’s digital world. In this paper, we create a game theoretic model in continuous time. We consider a dynamic game model of the bitcoin market, where miners or players use mining systems to mine bitcoin by investing electricity into the mining system. Although this work is motivated by {BTC}, the work presented can be applicable to other mining systems similar to {BTC}. We propose three concepts of dynamic game theoretic solutions to the model: Social optimum, Nash equilibrium and myopic Nash equilibrium. Using the model that a player represents a single “miner” or a “mining pool”, we develop novel and interesting results for the cryptocurrency world.},

	abstract = {The transparency and immutability properties offered by the burgeoning field of blockchain technology make it an increasingly popular choice for applications across many domains. One such application is online gaming. Blockchain offers participants the ability to verify the fairness of games in a manner previously unattainable by the classical centralized approach. However, the introduction of blockchain incurs additional overhead and poses unique challenges necessary to overcome in order to be a viable alternative. The transparency blockchain provides opens potential avenues for collusion, particularly in multiplayer games, which must be addressed. Furthermore, the emulation of random state, a core component of online gaming, is rendered difficult in a decentralized context. No approach exists which manages random state for multiplayer gaming in a completely decentralized manner. We propose a novel approach toward this end, significantly extending the utility of blockchain technology to online gaming.},

	title = {Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System},
	abstract = {A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of {CPU} power. As long as a majority of {CPU} power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},
